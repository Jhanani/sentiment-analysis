Genuinely moving and a beautiful farewell to a beloved series, Toy Story 3 is the must-see movie of the summer.	2013-11-09
Consider it one last farewell to the innocence of youth and bid adieu to this Story.	2013-09-15
Sit back, put on your glasses, and enjoy: It's summer, and Pixar has made you a treat.	2013-08-04
When teenaged Andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl, the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure -- a concise, deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting.	2013-08-04
There are many sweet laughs and joking allusions to horror and prison-break movies, but the Pixar gang gets at the most primary fear -- being cast off and no longer of use.	2013-08-04
While the concept has turned darker, Toy Story 3 carries it off brilliantly.	2013-08-04
The whole project is so masterfully conceived and executed that you either go along for the ride or sit in stunned appreciation for how singularly Pixar has maintained control over the creative quality of its output.	2013-08-04
I seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer.	2013-08-04
From 1995's Toy Story to now, we know these are not mere toys. Woody, Buzz and the rest have inner lives of their own, demonstrating unconditional loyalty, love, camaraderie and tearjerking nostalgia.	2013-08-04
This one wraps up the series perfectly and lets us all move on.	2013-06-22
... this is [Pixar's] prison film, and they load it with suspense, clever references, invention and action.	2012-09-29
While this is a good sequel, I wish it had had more of the emotion that had made the first two films so memorable.	2012-09-25
It's still more inventive, clever and laugh-out-loud funny than any other movie out there now.	2011-10-07
Toy Story 3 is probably the best of the series ...	2011-06-30
Another worthy entry in a much-heralded series that amounts to a prison break story as exciting in its own way as Steve McQueen's "The Great Escape".	2011-05-25
"Toy Story 3" is a bit on the safe side, hemmed in by its concept from offering the imagination that makes the best Pixar has to offer so good ... but the filmmakers still understand real heart.	2011-03-21
I can understand the creators not wanting to sugarcoat life merely because the colors are brighter and voices chirpier, but why is Toy Story 3 so intent on being such a manipulative downer?	2010-12-30
Woody, Buzz & Co. triumph again but lose a bit of magic.	2010-12-25
Pixar have once again reminded me that there is a way to create a film that not only appeals to just about everyone, but also prove that three-quels need not suck.	2010-11-15
A story with timeless, universal themes: family, coming of age (and leaving behind childish things), and the inevitable time when, past our prime, we will all face potential social obsolence. [Blu-ray]	2010-11-07
These toys may be old, but there's still plenty of mileage left in 'em.	2010-11-06
It's funny, warm, clever, exciting and touching, a story of friendship and imagination and a last blast of childhood joy...	2010-11-04
It may be darker, but favorite moments abound in this film--Pixar treats that make "Toy Story 3" a fun film to watch over and over.	2010-10-25
The question was never going to be, 'Is Toy Story 3 any good?' ... The question could only be, 'To what degree does Toy Story 3 make you wish you could grab a hold of the wonder that is life and squeeze it as if it were a teddy bear?'	2010-10-21
Toy Story 3 has all the sass, action, and derring do of the Indiana Jones movies, the charm, admiration, and fun of its predecessors and cousins at Pixar, and enough laughter and imagination to fuel generations to come,	2010-10-15
Impecable produccion en todos sentidos... sin embargo, es una version menos blanca y mas cargada de dramatismo. Una cinta mas para adultos que para ninos.	2010-09-19
The Toy Story movies have always been impossible not to love thanks to their mixture of heart, humour and action, but this last goodbye is the best yet.	2010-08-18
Toy Story 3 is equal parts hilarious, touching, insightful and exciting and anyone who doesn't come out smiling probably isn't human.	2010-07-29
full review at Movies for the Masses	2010-07-29
Bonnie is a touching tribute to the unbridled childhood imagination -- quite clearly, the kind of child who grows up to be a Pixar animator.	2010-07-27
The best film Pixar have ever made.	2010-07-22
By [Pixar's] high standards this isn't the best, but by anyone else's, it's close to perfection.	2010-07-22
I tried stuffing paper into my nose and into my mouth and in my ears to stop the flow. It was hopeless. Toy Story 3 is not only a masterpiece but is the most heart-rending film I have ever seen.	2010-07-22
The perfect film does not, and cannot, exist. But if it did, it would probably look a lot like this.	2010-07-22
Even the hardest of hearts will have melted by the time the lights come back up.	2010-07-20
It's a sign of Pixar's ongoing brilliance that even when there would appear to be no real need for another Toy Story sequel the studio delivers one that feels utterly essential.	2010-07-19
Toy Story 3 surpasses the 1995 original and its 1999 sequel for thrills, spills and laughs, delivering the most satisfying journey of the trilogy.	2010-07-16
It's an effortlessly superior family movie.	2010-07-15
I doubt we'll see better all year.	2010-07-15
This is an almost flawless example of a movie that will keep pretty much any person of any age enthralled and entertained.	2010-07-15
It's a film that moves as much as it entertains, that will make adults cry as much as -- perhaps even more than -- younger children.	2010-07-15
A film to enrapture children, and make adults weep. Plastic cowboy hats off to Pixar once again.	2010-07-15
The 'Toy Story' films are deservedly seen as the gold standard for computer-generated animation...	2010-07-15
Toy Story 3 is clever, inventive and deeply moving, a fabulous film which can be enjoyed by all ages -- and you can't say that about many movies.	2010-07-15
If there were a Nobel Prize for Digital Animation it would have been won almost every year by Pixar.	2010-07-15
The glow of originality may have dimmed, but Pixar's third rummage in the toy box delivers exactly what it's supposed to, with appealing fringe benefits.	2010-07-15
A fitting, poignant close to the series, and -- thankfully -- entertaining not only for kids of all ages, but people of all ages too.	2010-07-15
Like an overdue reunion with an old friend... it's a trilogy that's grown up without losing its soul.	2010-07-09
An absolutely dreadful summer at the movies is rescued by the wizards at Pixar.	2010-07-07
Toy Story 3 expertly combines dazzling visuals and thrilling adventure, with a touching story about saying goodbye to old friends.	2010-07-06
It captures the essence of selfishness and treachery, all under the guise of creating a system geared toward making it easier for college kids to get laid. And sure enough, in the end, just about everybody gets screwed.	2013-12-02
The Social Network is a spellbinding and compelling story with top notch performances and flawless directing.	2013-11-09
Fincher keeps the movie's tech-y elements on the periphery, focusing instead on the time-honored dramatic elements of isolation, determination, avarice and betrayal.	2013-08-17
The Social Network is splendid entertainment from a master storyteller, packed with energetic incident and surprising performances.	2013-06-14
The movie that shows you just what being "the smartest guy in the room" will get you.	2013-01-27
Aaron Sorkin's amazing script and several great performances make this one of the best movies of 2010.	2013-01-06
The Social Network may not turn out to be the definitive movie made about the plugged-in generation, but it's a pretty good start.	2012-09-28
Fincher's keen eye for direction and Sorkin's sharp script make this worth seeing for fans and non-fans of [Facebook] alike.	2012-09-23
Director David Fincher seems drawn to these stories of misguided rebels who become monsters in their attempts to reorder the world.	2012-06-12
Even if you've never touched a computer in your life, you'll find plenty to be fascinated by in this movie, as it shows that, whilst technology may be moving fast, the human capacity for hubris will always remain the same.	2011-12-13
... A classic American story of capitalism and greed, friendship and betrayal, fueled by envy and lost innocence ...	2011-11-05
At last, a movie you can actually discuss afterward. And not just on Facebook or Twitter. No, you'll want to chew it over in person, with friends, for hours.	2011-10-07
It's hard work making a character you don't like into a character you don't like, but can still respect.	2011-08-15
Perhaps we've become a world of Mark Zuckerbergs and it's clear that these filmmakers don't like it one bit.	2011-06-29
It's part Citizen Kane, part Goodfellas, part Revenge of the Nerds and the most entertaining film you never knew you would want to see.	2011-04-04
The Social Network is so engrossing you don't even notice how heavy handed the films central dramatic irony could be -- that the greatest tool for communication in the modern age was created by someone who has no idea how to relate to other people.	2011-04-01
I've read a lot about The Social Network at this point, mostly raves about how it supposedly captures The Way We Live Now, but no one has really zeroed in on how deliberately alienating it is.	2011-02-23
You wouldn't think that [Fincher & Sorkin's] talents would gel, yet their collaboration on The Social Network is brilliant ... a gripping tale of ambition and envy, betrayal and resentment.	2011-02-15
That the project is not only a success but one of 2010&#8242;s best films is a testament to Fincher's talent as a director and his seemingly perennial ability to surround himself with incredibly astute, like-minded collaborators.	2011-02-14
Almost certainly deliberately indebted to [Citizen] Kane, a quality that wordlessly speaks to Zuckerberg's own inflated ego.	2011-01-28
he Social Network occupies a gray area, in which everybody's perspective is in question, and most of the main characters slip into self-serving, subjective realities. ... an ingenious way to tackle a very curious, contemporary case	2011-01-27
There's a real mischievousness to David Fincher's approach.	2011-01-19
Enormously entertaining, thought-provoking and fascinating despite a flawed, possibly biased screenplay.	2011-01-16
The merits of Facebook can be debated; the merits of The Social Network are undeniable.	2011-01-10
Directed with typical technical fastidiousness and textural richness by David Fincher from a verbally dexterous script by Aaron Sorkin...	2011-01-09
An intellectual property battle ripped from today's headlines that feels like a cyber-thriller, yet it never once turns into a heavy-handed message movie.	2010-12-27
An invigorating and vital film.	2010-12-20
The genesis of Facebook as weepy bromance	2010-12-06
full review at Movies for the Masses	2010-11-20
A relevant exploration in to the changing of communication and socializing through a man who built an empire around the inability to tell people how he really felt...	2010-11-19
Snappy script, sharp editing, eerily perfect soundtrack and nuanced performances. One of the first films to articulate the psychological power and draw of the internet: what it feeds us and why we feed on it	2010-11-10
Just how much of the story is really true is anyone's guess but the brilliant script and Eisenberg's performance make it worth seeing in any case.	2010-11-04
The need to belong drives the men behind a revolution in the slick biopic The Social Network.	2010-11-03
The great irony is that the biggest player in the social networking boom proved to be someone so socially retarded he borders on sociopathic at times.	2010-11-01
I'm really not making this up. My best friend Emily called me half an hour before I left to see 'The Social Network.' And guess what she wanted to know? 'This woman who went to high school with us wants to friend me,' she said. 'Do you remember her?'	2010-10-30
Fincher and Sorkin, who clearly acknowledged that the meat of the plot was in examining the diverse characters involved, are to be applauded.	2010-10-30
The Social Network's portrait of Zuckerberg, replete with the jerky rhythms and constant scanning of the truly net addicted, epitomises that change. For that, and some very fine drama indeed, this film is a must-see.	2010-10-28
It's a credit to the combined efforts of Fincher and Sorkin that the dramatic tension can (more than once) culminate in the refreshing of a website.	2010-10-28
This is a beautifully made film by David Fincher with a superb screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.	2010-10-27
Like Zuckerberg, Fincher excels at data management, delivering vast amounts of information with the utmost clarity and speed.	2010-10-27
This masterful, contentious and gripping biopic downloads us deep inside the control-alt-delete mind of the creator of Facebook, and then throws away the escape key.	2010-10-27
Wherever the truth lies, The Social Network is an innately compelling, beautifully crafted insight into the emergence of a global phenomenon and the disintegration of a rare friendship.	2010-10-26
A film of our times that captures the spirit of a generation that isn't prepared to wait their turn or pay their dues and instead will make the opportunities for themselves or tear it away from the less ambitious.	2010-10-26
This picture helps convey the significance of the social media revolution; the one that simultaneously brings us together and tears us apart. The Social Network is scarily good. It gets us.	2010-10-25
In a superlative example of art-imitating-life, there was definite alchemy at work on the set of The Social Network...nothing short of a masterpiece.	2010-10-25
It's a shamelessly biased account, as well as a seductively plausible one, although you have to keep your wits about you to get the full effect.	2010-10-25
Fincher has delivered his best work since Seven. An even better period drama than Zodiac and even more relevant to our generation today than Fight Club.	2010-10-25
Clever, cutting and debateable, The Social Network should inspire discussion -- most likely played out on Facebook -- for months to come.	2010-10-25
It doesn't take but a few minutes into the film for us to realize we're not only watching Fincher's strongest film to date, but the year's as well.	2010-10-25
Fincher has constructed a wonderfully balanced tale of a young narcissistic genius in want of status and recognition.	2010-10-23
A fascinating study in how two films can follow the same source material fairly closely but come up with interpretations so tonally, spiritually different--but equally valid.	2013-09-15
Fantastic performances all around, great dialogue and damn fine filmmaking make this one of the best of the year.	2013-08-11
With his leisurely growl, somewhere between trail-grizzled and post-nap, Bridges sounds as if he's talking through his collar, in a vocal performance that's entertaining no matter what he's saying.	2013-07-01
Duke has been usurped by the Dude, and I couldn't be more thrilled by the experience of watching one of our finest actors take a role as iconic as Rooster Cogburn and indisputably make it his own.	2013-05-25
It may not rank among the Coen Brothers' greatest works, but their new adaptation of the Portis novel is intriguing to watch, beautifully filmed, and well worth taking a look at for the fascinating characters.	2012-09-21
True Grit is as close to Disney as the Coens get. And go figure, this time out, it is meant as a compliment.	2012-07-12
Non-gritty update a step up from John Wayne and Glen Campbell	2012-04-15
... The best of both worlds: a classic Western and classic Coen brothers.	2011-11-05
...a traditional Western that's been augmented with a number of irresistibly off-kilter elements.	2011-11-02
Not as out-there as Lebowski, as bleak as No Country, or as twisted as Fargo, but it crackles, like a good campfire, with colorful Coen flourishes all the same.	2011-09-09
Either I'm softening on the Coens or they are softening themselves. Not as darkly comic as their prior films, this western is easily one of their better films.	2011-08-15
The dialogue zings with period flourish and point-blank delivery.	2011-07-14
Jeff Bridges is rough and rowdy marshal Ruben "Rooster" Cogburn, and manages to put his own stamp on the role made famous in 1969 by John Wayne. It's no surprise that he knows how to bring a wide palette of colors to this character, and he seems to be...	2011-06-23
The title refers to the trait Mattie needs in her avenger, though the film sympathizes with the criminal outcasts.	2011-06-13
... the most accessible and successful (financially speaking) film of their career.	2011-06-11
This True Grit is timeless.	2011-06-06
The new movie really is quite different from the older one, and in almost every way an improvement.	2011-05-21
A marvelous film. The highlight is the performance of Hailee Steinfeld as the young heroine, Mattie Ross, but also boasting strong turns by Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon.	2011-05-18
The brothers' fidelity to Portis' novel not only honors a great literary achievement but also makes for a narrative with fascinating interruptions, digressions and enigmatic encounters...	2011-05-01
This isn't the deepest Western or the most thoughtful Coen brothers film, but dang if it isn't a good time.	2011-04-04
There's a first time for everything and, finally, now there's a Coen Brothers movie that you can watch alongside your parents without them complaining that it's too weird.	2011-04-04
Does Damon spend the whole movie doing his Matthew McConaughey impression? Yeah. If you've seen the bit in question, it's actually kind of distracting.	2011-03-06
Mas que una remake, una readaptacion de la novela original hecha con mayor fidelidad. En sus mejores momentos (y Temple de Acero tiene varios buenos momentos) los Coen siguen demostrando por que son dos de los mas brillantes cineastas de la actualidad.	2011-02-26
Bridges is a riot, and Damon proves himself once again. But it's Steinfeld who most amazes; more than a child actor, she's an actual performer, playing a character.	2011-02-25
It's a superior film in every way to Henry Hathaway's original, though that film shouldn't be discounted.	2011-02-14
This masterful, touching, and hugely entertaining picture is a rousing depiction of manly leadership and moral certitude set in a world unencumbered by political correctness.	2011-02-14
The Coen brothers' excellent western True Grit is a second and rather different version of Charles Portis's novel, rather than a remake of the 1969 film that brought John Wayne an Oscar as the one-eyed bounty hunter Marshal Rooster Cogburn.	2011-02-14
Solid, classy entertainment with something for practically everyone, from casual film fans to Coen brothers obsessives.	2011-02-14
True Grit is the third film the Coen brothers have made since the triumph of No Country for Old Men. It's just as characteristic and deserves just as much success.	2011-02-11
At an uncertain time for heroes in America, there's no wonder it's packing 'em in.	2011-02-11
The Dude fills the Duke's boots for straight-shooting Coens.	2011-02-11
What makes True Grit truly brilliant, however, isn't just the Coens' reverence for the style and tone of the Westerns of yesteryear, but the John Ford-inspired manner in which they manage to both epitomise and eulogise the myth of the Old West...	2011-02-11
Ate mesmo John Wayne seria obrigado a reconhecer a superioridade desta nova versao.	2011-02-11
Like a cowboy lassoed behind a horse, the Coen brothers have dragged the Western kicking and screaming into the 21st Century... and How!	2011-02-10
It meanders along, convinced of its own idiosyncratic suavity, never venturing out of its makers' comfort zones.	2011-02-10
The Coens are nothing if not film buffs, and their framings lovingly copy earlier movies, most noticeably John Ford's The Searchers and Charles Laughton's Night Of The Hunter.	2011-02-10
This True Grit is a very impressive piece of work, beautifully photographed by Roger Deakins, and if you had never seen the original, it might be getting even higher praise.	2011-02-10
A riveting ride with a fabulous cast.	2011-02-10
Not surprisingly, Joel and Ethan Coen's True Grit is leaner, meaner and funnier than the 1969 John Wayne Western that first put grizzled US Marshal Rooster Cogburn on screen.	2011-02-10
Hugely enjoyable, pleasingly old-fashioned (and Oscar nominated) Western that gets everything right...	2011-02-09
A series of photogravures formed into an elegant, high-toned flip book.	2011-02-09
It could be the Coens' most straightforward film, but it's also one of their best.	2011-02-09
Great stuff.	2011-02-09
Remakes that outdo the original are as rare as a brimstone preacher in a saloon bar...but this leaves Henry Hathaway's 60s version stone dead.	2011-02-09
True Grit stands as an impressive deconstruction (and revalorisation) of the western genre, as a vast improvement on Hathaway's True Grit from the late Sixties, and as a collection of excellent performances, fine technique and oddball moments	2011-02-08
Imagine you heard the Coen brothers had gone and made a straight-up Western. Now imagine Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin and Matt Damon were in it. As movie news goes, that's on a par with Christina Hendricks signing up for the Piranha 3D sequel.	2011-02-07
Terrific: tough, exciting, funny, gorgeous and bewitchingly acted, this is darn close to perfection.	2011-02-07
The kind of slam-bang entertainment that's rare in filmmaking today and is truly the grittiest western of the decade.	2011-02-06
Even if the movie doesn't immediately blow you away like a shotgun blast, it'll creep up on you like rattlesnake venom.	2011-02-03
Bridges' performance as Cogburn is so good you can almost smell the whiskey as he growls and drawls his way through the script.	2011-02-03
This 'toon doesn't lack heart amid all the high-flying antics, but it may have benefited from a heartier dose of imagination.	2014-05-21
When the film flies, it soars.	2014-05-17
...few fans of the original are likely to be truly disappointed, and the film is certainly in the top tier of the studio's output. It's just a shame that it doesn't quite have the same beating heart as its predecessor.	2014-05-16
... this is how franchises are supposed to work.	2014-05-16
Going beyond the pat eco-conscious message that every kids' film has to have, HTTYD2 touches on how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can be.	2014-05-16
This smartly paced sequel does a great job of drawing out the lead characters, expanding the world they exist in and adding in some warm hearted and moving moments.	2014-05-16
This DreamWorks Animation sequel advances the story without sacrificing the integrity that defined its most atypical toon.	2014-05-16
Ferguson is so mad he's punching at whatever's in front of him. It's understandable, but this is more polemic than documentary.	2013-06-22
This eye-opening documentary is critical of both parties in its search for answers about the causes of the 2008 economic collapse.	2013-01-06
Who whacked the economy?	2012-04-15
As a documentary, this is a clear-eyed, steadily building prosecution against Wall Street. But, in the end, Ferguson's film is just a moot trial in which the defendants have already escaped scot-free.	2012-01-30
This is a powerful and coherent work that will explain where the money has gone. It just can't help get restitution against those who did it.	2011-12-13
More entertaining than Wall Street 2 while saying infinitely more about the iniquities of those that claim to work for us.	2011-08-16
This is a compelling documentary that will have you leaving the cinema absolutely seething.	2011-07-14
Ultimately, Inside Job will not have much to offer those who follow financial news reports.	2011-07-13
Inside Job offers a concise history in a documentary that speaks to everyone and knows exactly who's to blame.	2011-06-11
Muchos aspectos tecnicos probablemente se le escapen a quienes no tengan al menos un conocimiento basico sobre temas economicos y financieros, pero cualquiera podra entender y compartir las conclusiones a las que llega este contundente documental.	2011-05-18
A forceful argument about the dangers of unchecked greed and brazen lack of accountability.	2011-04-13
Throughout, the interviewer goes beyond standard bland. From off-screen, his barbed questions are relentless in forcing heads to follow dotted lines and confront inconsistencies.	2011-03-31
We want them to go to jail and realize the horror of what they've done? Is that too much to hope for? The answer may be too hard to face.	2011-03-14
An insightful and very sorry tale of the worst kind of greed, this Oscar-winning documentary exposes the people behind the global financial crisis, men & woman who are still wealthy and still running the banking industry.	2011-03-10
Inside Job is far more watchable than it should be.	2011-03-01
Inside Job is essential and empowering viewing about institutionalised corporate greed	2011-02-27
I've only scratched the surface of this intelligent, riveting and informative film, which I cannot commend too highly.	2011-02-22
Ferguson is more IF Stone than Michael Moore and is genuinely interested in getting answers, keeping himself out of the frame and only allowing his voice to intrude on the talking-head interviews when blatant spin needs to be challenged.	2011-02-22
Likely to be one of the most shocking and edifying cinematic experiences of 2011.	2011-02-20
Here's the biggest story of our time, lucidly told.	2011-02-18
Ferguson takes a scalpel to the banking industry and peels away the layers to reveal the rot inside. Essential viewing.	2011-02-18
A shocking and brilliant film.	2011-02-18
It depicts with admirable clarity the insanity of the boom that led to bust. If you have ever wanted to understand derivatives, hedge funds and collateralised debt obligation, this movie is for you.	2011-02-17
Inside Job tackles the mess head-on with a kind of bitter pragmatism, reconstructing the system that failed and circling its weak spots.	2011-02-17
Overall you're left knowing money was creamed off all too easily from a system badly in need of improvement, and the uncomfortable knowledge that some of the key perpetrators may still be in positions of power.	2011-02-17
This film is as gripping as any thriller. Aided by some fascinating interviews, Ferguson lays out an awful story.	2011-02-17
An insightful and thought-provoking doc that will enrage and frustrate after digestion.	2011-02-17
It's a fascinating but terrifying insight into a very murky world.	2011-02-17
What sounds like a rather dry box office offering actually turns out to be a frightening, hilarious and ultimately rousing experience.	2011-02-17
A good friend summed up Inside Job best when he called it 'the comedy of the year'. It's true.	2011-02-17
It's a horror movie, in a way, one designed to make you angry and want to do something about it.	2011-02-16
If you're not spitting bile by the end of Inside Job, check your pulse.	2011-02-16
By turns riveting, rage-inducing and utterly depressing, this is a well made, superbly written documentary that demands to be seen and thoroughly deserves its Oscar nomination.	2011-02-16
A glossy, stylish documentary that'll make you really, really angry.	2011-02-16
You'll need a clear head to follow this impressive and angry American doc about the financial meltdown...	2011-02-16
A straightforward and very shocking account of the meltdown that's guaranteed to give you a healthy jolt of righteous rage.	2011-02-16
Charles Ferguson's documentary - unlike the subject matter he is broaching - makes a virtue of economy.	2011-02-16
Charles Ferguson, whose previous film was another cogent account of US failure, is an important contemporary historian. His style may be a little flat, but the material and the arguments are indispensable.	2011-02-15
Inside Job, which looks at the causes and consequences of the 2008 economic collapse, is truly terrifying cinema-viewing.	2011-02-15
This comprehensive analysis of the Global Financial Crisis makes for powerful -- if disheartening -- viewing.	2011-02-15

I've been angry pretty much since the fall of 2008. Or should I say The Fall of 2008? I know so many people who have lost jobs, lost their homes, lost their savings ... I won't go on and on. All I could think of was: 'Didn't someone see this coming?'	2011-02-12

This conversion of garbage into humanitarian aid is just the beginning. Practical charity gives way to life-changing intimacy.	2012-06-12
The breadth of gratitude these catadores feel towards Muniz and the life-experience they undertake makes for an intelligent, emotional movie.	2011-11-30

Walker creates indelible documentary portraits of six workers that round out Muniz's very unusual physical portraits. [Not] the usual saccharine shock at poverty.	2011-02-07
It shows us how artists find ideas and concepts for their work from the most unlikely sources, and it demonstrates the power of art to spark curiosity and cultural awareness in even the poorest, most underprivileged people.	2011-01-31
An entirely immersing documentary, one of those movies whose real value comes in the way it envelops viewers in a world they never knew existed.	2011-01-17
A feel-good rarity that descends neither to cuteness nor sentimentality, does not editorialize, either, but lets subject, and subjects, show us what it's all about.	2011-01-09
A fascinating film, offering a glimpse of a world we've never seen before ... allowing us to savor the unexpected power in the phrase, 'Recycle yourself.'	2011-01-04
It overs a lot of ground, from a huge landfill, to the run-down shacks where the workers live, to the elite world of art auctions where thousands of dollars are paid for works of art featuring garbage and poor workers.	2010-12-30

It makes for a good human interest story.	2010-12-21
Comovente, doce, tragico e inspirador.	2010-12-17

It's not a very good title, Waste Land - this isn't a bleak film, at all - but just about everything else in Lucy Walker's documentary works, and illuminates.	2010-12-02
Waste Land is inspirational without seeming self-righteous, and moving without being hackneyed.	2010-11-24
"Waste Land" is a film about recycling, but it's far more intriguing than the average eco-documentary.	2010-11-19
"Waste Land" has some things in common with "The Gleaners & I," Agnes Varda's wonderful 2000 nonfiction film about French field workers. But "Waste Land" goes even further.	2010-11-18

Brooklyn artist Vik Muniz helps tell the story of the city at the biggest landfill in the world. But are the right people watching?	2010-11-05
That a beautiful film could be set in the world's largest garbage dump sounds like an oxymoron, but acclaimed documentarian Lucy Walker has pulled off precisely that feat in her profoundly moving "Waste Land."	2010-11-04
[An] inspiring documentary.	2010-11-03
[Muniz's] intention to have them re-create photographic images of themselves out of garbage, while it may not pass muster as high art, has the effect of raising their spirits. At least for a while, their lives, and ours, have been transformed.	2010-11-01
Captivating, inspirational and profoundly eye-opening. It's a testament to the true healing power of art.	2010-10-31
Rather than issuing a warning blow to either our guts or our hearts, it's something of a soft wakeup nudge aimed somewhere in-between.	2010-10-31
But what's so surprising about Poetry is Lee's unassuming mastery over the elements therein.	2014-06-02

Those with an eye for reading between the lines can find layers of meaning.	2012-01-04

A fascinating, satisfying film with a remarkable central performance.	2011-07-31
In the way of good cinema, the full experience is entirely unsentimental and poetic.	2011-07-29
It is a picture of something inexpressibly gentle and sad, something heartbreaking and absolutely normal, but something stirred up by a violent, alien incursion.	2011-07-28
Beautifully shot, brilliantly written and featuring a terrific lead performance from Yun Jung-hee, this is a thought provoking, emotionally engaging drama that would make a superb double bill with Bong Joon-ho's Mother.	2011-07-28
How many times have we seen the components of this plot? The crimes of the young; the trials of the old; the lone individual fighting for truth and decency. But they were never mixed like this before.	2011-07-28
What makes Poetry so involving is that it's never clear how the story will be resolved.	2011-07-28
From Alzheimer's, rape and suicide, Lee has created real poetry.	2011-07-28
Yoon's performance, nuanced and subtle, is superb, while the film is long and languid so adjustments and allowances must be made both for its pace and, at times, for its poetry. But the effort is well worth it.	2011-07-28
[Yun Jung-hee's] quiet gestures, gentle gaze and tender pose transform themselves into stanzas as they rhyme with Lee's cinema.	2011-07-27

Well-crafted and compelling, if a little inaccessible to western audiences...	2011-07-24
Sensitive, almost to a fault, Lee Chang Dong's Poetry is a well-observed but minor effort from one of the top Korean filmmakers.	2011-07-13
Poetry possesses a lyrical delicateness that marks it as something special, different and thought-provoking.	2011-05-22
Writer and director Chang-dong Lee's film is moving without ever stooping to melodrama; Yun is the main reason why.	2011-05-19
He leaves a lot of loose ends in "Poetry," letting the viewer form his or her own interpretation of what happened and what it means. But the ending, especially the devastating final shots, feels complete and perfect.	2011-05-13
"Poetry" is daring in the ways only quiet, unhurried but finally haunting films have the courage to be.	2011-05-05
At the end of this film, the significance of Mija's experience is felt in full, creeping up on the viewer in a manner that mirrors the effect of great creative writing.	2011-05-04
Like the flowing waters in its opening shot, Poetry is a beautiful film that carries us along slowly, subtly, yet unrelentingly.	2011-04-29
Has a strong flavor of daytime-drama soap.	2011-04-28
A Korean movie about an aging housemaid that turns out to be one of the best films of the year.	2011-04-08
Lee is a gifted, thoughtful filmmaker, unafraid to tackle difficult subjects.	2011-04-07

A captivating film, as observant and nuanced as a sonnet.	2011-03-17
Completely engrossing.	2011-03-07
Yet another great, neo-noirish effort from South Korea (the other was the recent release "The Housemaid"), "Poetry" tells a -story that no American film studio would go near.	2011-03-07
Absolutely captivating... stimulating even though it really does seem like it ought to be sedative.	2011-03-05
Now is the time to bestow on yourself the gift of one of the most, well, poetic films of 2010. And by "poetic," we mean rich with soulful pauses that are at once visual and aural and deeply observant of the dance of routine and quiet surprise.	2011-03-04
About guilt and responsibility, about loss, about the terrible things human beings do, and the moments of serenity and spiritual succor to be gleaned from the natural world.	2011-03-03
Sometimes you don't fully appreciate what a movie's doing to your heart until it's been shattered.	2011-03-03
A chronicle of complex joy and devastation, with a slight tendency to ramble.	2011-02-25
Mija, at the center, is perhaps determined to not fill her remaining memories with despair, and to avoid adding to the sum of the world's misery. Maybe it's as simple as that.	2011-02-25
This is a small film. It is also a great one. "Great" is a word I don't use often.	2011-02-24
[An] exquisite Korean drama by Secret Sunshine's Lee Chang-dong.	2011-02-16
A graceful melodrama with the feel and texture of an absorbing novel.	2011-02-16
A film that elevates Lee Chang-dong to the pantheon of directors who make great art out of the suffering of ordinary people: Satyajit Ray, Ousmane Sembene and Akira Kurosawa. A great work of art about the pain and aspirations of the lowly.	2011-02-15
As Mija searches for poetic inspiration, "Poetry" filmgoers will revel in it.	2011-02-15
"Poetry," which rightfully won the best-screenplay prize at Cannes, never resorts to exploitation. Under Lee's guidence, it is a mature film for mature audiences.	2011-02-11
What saved Poetry for me is the brilliant, lyrical and powerful way that Lee manages to sum up all his themes during the final few minutes.	2011-02-11
Lee's film lives up to its title.	2011-02-10
Ms. Yun's performance [is] a tour de force of emotional complexity that builds through restraint and, like Mr. Lee's unadorned visual style, earns rather than demands your attention.	2011-02-10
This is a movie about how in the throes of inspiration, phrases follow each other organically, leading the poet to places she didn't know she was headed when she began. But for Yun, that journey is terrifying, with only blackness ahead.	2011-02-10
sprawling, superb	2011-02-10
Call it a glossy inspirational inversion of Pygmalion, or a sports flick for those who prefer royals to athletes, but there's no denying the universal appeal of director Tom Hooper's tastefully wrapped package.	2014-01-14
Surprisingly funny.	2014-01-14
The King's Speech features a fantastic, awards courting performance by Firth and is also brilliantly written, resulting in a surprisingly tense and very entertaining watch.	2013-11-09

An inspiring story about one man's quest to overcome a speech impediment to lead his nation.	2013-06-30
Tom Hooper delves beneath the pomp and circumstance to root out the essence of his characters, while also making them immensely relatable.	2013-05-26

A charming, personal period drama.	2013-02-16
See it, then say it for yourself: The King's Speech is the best movie of 2010.	2013-02-16
The King's Speech is an entertainingly crafted movie that doesn't linger too long in the mind.	2013-02-16
It's a fine, absorbing work, built with brilliance and without excessive showiness or flash. It feels, in fact, like a classic virtually upon its arrival.	2013-02-16
The relationship between a commoner teacher and regal student provides for enough drama, and the obstacle overcome is both inspiring and unique.	2013-02-16
A powerful back story does not necessarily improve a movie, but The King's Speech has a pretty irresistible one. It might even end with a dramatic night at the Oscars in February.	2013-02-16
In The King's Speech, Colin Firth once again reminds us of what a great actor he is.	2013-02-16
Classic, rousing entertainment loaded with both humor and poignancy.	2013-02-16
Polished, thoughtful and touching.	2013-02-16
The King's Speech is the rare work of art that's also an immense crowdpleaser.	2013-02-16
Too ingratiating to resonate deeply.	2013-02-16
Inspiring, funny, touching, and delivered with craftsmanship and artistry.	2013-02-16
It's refreshing to see a historical drama avoid grand gestures and sweeping melodrama in favor of smaller more intimate stories.	2013-02-16
The King's Speech is admirably free of easy answers and simple, happy endings; it's a skewed, awards-ready version of history, but one polished to a fine, satisfying shine.	2013-02-16
A feel-good movie with a hearty dose of history and a hint of edge, a most-deserving Oscar winner	2013-01-15
Despite the obvious movie structure that gets forced onto historical events, The King's Speech is a terrific film with great performances and an inspiring story.	2012-10-04
It's not quite the world-beating effort the British film press might have you thinking it is, but it's a perfectly functional, frequently enjoyable biopic that knows the right buttons to push and has all the right people pushing them.	2012-09-28
It's a wonderfully delightful film filled with great performances, particularly from Firth and Rush. This is one of the best films of the year and should not be missed.	2012-09-22
Every quality amounts to a big so what? for me.	2012-07-11
( ... ) a British film where the swearing isn't a bolted-on means of trying to appeal to the cloth-eared.	2011-12-29
The story is consistently fascinating (though it certainly plays rather fast and loose with historical facts) whilst Hooper manages to wring dramatic tension out of some of the most seemingly mundane incidents.y.	2011-12-13
Firth is simply magnificent ...	2011-11-05
The King's Speech is simultaneously cozy and majestic.	2011-09-07
A humorous look at an oft-ignored section of British history.	2011-08-15
This is a film worth talking about.	2011-07-14
It is a rare movie indeed that successfully uses empathy rather than sympathy. We feel what the character feels, instead of feeling for them.	2011-06-22
This movie took me by surprise -- I had no idea that it that would be the most satisfying, affecting buddy movie of the recent past.	2011-04-29
A British production featuring meticulous period detail, outstanding performances from Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter, and inventive staging and visuals	2011-04-23
Movies like this allow you to fall in love with a historical family you probably wouldn't want to be friends with otherwise.	2011-04-04
Why did Edward abdicate again? What am I, a history professor?	2011-03-06
Can't be defined by its 'R' rating or by the 'period piece' label. It may be about a king, but it speaks to the royalty in all of us.	2011-03-04
The threat of world war looms outside the door, but the movie is really about one man, at war with himself, and the people close to him who helped him find peace.	2011-03-04
Witty script, quirky performances, flawless casting and wonderfully inventive cinematography. Golf claps all round.	2011-03-01
If it might typically be hard to feel too terribly sorry for one of the most privileged human beings ever to walk the planet... Firth more than makes up for that with what is one of the great performances not just of this year but in cinema history.	2011-02-27
The tone shifts, lamentably, from one buoyed by awkward comedy and very British charm to one that is more concerned with decorum and duty. What was a remarkably entertaining costume drama soon becomes a remarkable slog.	2011-02-25
Like similar films with populist appeal, it both embraces its feel-good intentions and wears them on its sleeve. And it executes its model to near perfection.	2011-02-25
Such is the power in Rush and Firth's performances that you can't wait until they're on-screen next.	2011-02-24
A compelling and gripping declaration of the impact of words and the power it can build in and around a kingdom...	2011-02-17
A conventional over-hyped picture lifted by unconventional fairly-hyped performances. Truly the m - m - most British movie ever made.	2011-02-12
Apesar de adoravel, e um grande filme? Uma obra que mereca, por exemplo, entrar no restritissimo clube das producoes indicadas a 12 Oscars ou mais? A resposta, temo, e um inequivoco "nao".	2011-02-10
Hooper has teased out of the brilliant script and Oscar-worthy central performances an electric crowd-pleaser that borrows the best of Brit period cinema...while eliding the very worst.	2011-02-10
An utterly absorbing relationship study between a Royal and a commoner ... shining gem in British cinema's crown jewels, full of wit and decorum.	2011-02-09

A soul-searching meditation on the past.	2011-09-26
...an almost perfect documentary, confronting history, memory, and science in a way that touches the heart, provokes the mind, and humbles the spirit.	2011-08-15
In this poetic - though overstated - documentary, Patricio Guzman ponders these two ways of looking back in time, merging the celestial and sublunary like Terrence Malick in The Tree of Life or Werner Herzog in Cave of Forgotten Dreams.	2011-06-10
A nearly unbearable examination of good and bad in the human heart.	2011-06-09
Original music, sure-handed editing, the stunning panorama and scope of the observatories, the desert and the night sky, plus the heartbreaking stories of the searchers, make this a top contender for best documentary.	2011-05-26

A film of rare visual poetry that's simultaneously personal, political and philosophical, it's a genuine art film that's also unpretentious and easygoing.	2011-04-21
"I am convinced that memory has gravitational force," says Guzman in conclusion. "Nostalgia" states his case so beautifully that even skeptical physicists will be thoroughly convinced.	2011-03-31
That rare documentary that's as thrilling as art as it is as reportage, a marvelously shaped thesis that's both disquieting and humbling.	2011-03-20
Interspersed are the awesome colored stills of nebulae, galaxies and stars that modern technology has been bringing back.	2011-03-18
Katell Djian's stunning cinematography adds to the film's power.	2011-03-18
Do not expect a lot of scientific knowledge, but the political message is strong and sincere.	2011-03-18
The film's passionate insistence on remembrance lends it a moral as well as a metaphysical weight. Mr. Guzman's belief in eternal memory is an astounding leap of faith.	2011-03-17
As a work of nonfiction, it deserves its own nomenclature. "Docu-poem" is too inelegant; "masterpiece" works, although it's been used before.	2011-03-17
A moving meditation on history, knowledge and mortality.	2011-03-16
Has the overwhelming power of an outrage to decency.	2011-03-14

Whatever this Times-produced, TV-ready tribute lacks in tension is amply compensated by the pleasure of watching an enthusiast ply the craft he loves.	2012-01-04

Bill has followed his bliss for 60 years, and it's a delight to follow him for 80 minutes - even if you have no interest in fashion. Don't miss it.	2011-11-24
It is both insightful and strangely moving.	2011-11-03
A wonderfully understated delight.	2011-10-30
This is a fascinating portrait of a unique character who has built his own world out the worlds of others. Quite unlike poseur photographers, he dresses, eats sleeps and talks simply; he gets around on a push bike. And he smiles a lot	2011-10-29
This is a rare and special film that should be savoured	2011-10-29
Maybe the world doesn't need a feature-length film about Cunningham; maybe we don't even need his pictures. But we need examples like his, people who retain a joyful individuality while fitting seamlessly into our crazy world.	2011-07-24

A heart-warming insight into one man's extraordinary life, a window to the fabulous veneer of the Big Apple and a must-see for anyone interested in the creative process.	2011-07-04
A portrait of a happy man.	2011-07-01
It's not just what he does. It's who he is. And he approaches it with such unbridled passion and joy that you can't help but sharing in it; absolutely no knowledge or love of fashion is required.	2011-06-23
As director Richard Press' exuberant, telling film nimbly reveals, here is a fashion purist who cares nothing for the trappings of the glittery world he inhabits. For Cunningham, it really is all about the clothes.	2011-06-14
[A] marvelous documentary.	2011-06-14
Charming documentary.	2011-06-13
A fascinating, endearing portrait of the man who for decades has documented trends born on the streets and beau-monde parties for a worthy cause.	2011-05-26
While certainly an affectionate and admiring portrait, Bill Cunningham New York, by its end, provides no revelations and left this viewer, at least, puzzling.	2011-05-20
Here is a movie about a happy and nice man.	2011-05-19
It's a great and modest film.	2011-05-06
Filmmaker Richard Press offers a humorous, touching and insightful portrait about a subject who clearly would have preferred to stay behind the camera.	2011-05-05
He finds beauty; watching him, we find joy.	2011-04-28
Bill Cunningham is a specimen who seems to be unique to New York, a celebrity whom 'everybody who is anybody' is acquainted with, but nobody knows.	2011-04-22
Bill Cunningham New York is a portrait of an extraordinary man who possesses such arcane knowledge as the difference between right and wrong.	2011-04-22
Bill Cunningham New York is as winning as its subject, the affable chronicler of New York style from the sidewalk to the runway.	2011-04-22
Bill Cunningham New York shows us a man who not only derives great pleasure from devoting himself to his job but also, in the process, has helped shaped the greatest city in the world.	2011-04-20
"Bill Cunningham New York" is a day in the life and a look at the lifelong career of Boston-born Bill Cunningham. Here is a man whose job is to go out into Manhattan on his bicycle every working day to seek and find beauty.	2011-04-08
Cunningham's work is about seeing and teaching us how to see, and that should be plenty for us.	2011-04-07
Equally at home chronicling the latest fashions on the street and the biggest celebrations among Manhattan's aristocratic swell set, he might as well be the city that forms his vast canvas.	2011-04-07
Holds your attention over its rather untidily assembled eighty minutes of on-the-fly footage by reason of what it reveals about [Cunningham's] almost monastic devotion to his work.	2011-04-07
It's as much a portrait of a kind of artist as it is a document of a city's evolving sense of style.	2011-04-07
Now in his 80s, this charming, kind man remains a mystery: is he the happiest man on earth, or the most closeted and loneliest?	2011-04-07
A beautiful portrait of a truly happy man.	2011-04-07
... a film which captures the spirit of Cunningham's work and life.	2011-04-01
Cunningham seems genuinely in love with his work...	2011-04-01
Lots of us are interested in clothes. But few can match Bill Cunningham's passion for fashion.	2011-03-31
I love this man, I love this movie.	2011-03-31
It's Cunningham's single-mindedness about his work that's so infectious as well as so strange.	2011-03-30
Obsessive artists often create exceptional bodies of work.	2011-03-24
The Town may not be perfect, but Affleck does a lot of things right, including picking some great actors and letting them do their jobs to deliver fine performances.	2014-01-05
Assured, confident direction by Affleck, terrifically paced action sequences and brilliant use of location turn The Town into a truly enjoyable movie.	2013-11-09
One of the great modern heist pictures.	2013-01-29
Action can be difficult for someone not experienced with it. Yet, Affleck shows that he's more than up to the task.	2012-09-23
'The Town' hits not one false note, despite a plot that easily could have come across as contrived.	2011-11-05
Because this all revolves around Affleck, The Town is a curiosity; directed by him under another name and it would be forgettable.	2011-08-18
Ben Affleck may not be his generation's best actor, but he is quickly becoming one of its best directors.	2011-08-15
If it just stuck to its guns The Town would be a fun, engaging heist film, but by reaching for more it ends up achieving less.	2011-03-21
The Town isn't original in any sense of the word, but Affleck does a marvelous job executing all of the pieces and is easily one of the best films of 2010.	2011-02-27
A grade A crime thriller.	2011-02-24
One of those rare cases that the previews are actually as good as the movie.	2011-01-03
A film can only be as riveting as its ability to have the audience believe or suspend belief, and though The Town takes steps toward authenticity, it fails to meet even the basic requirements of plausibility.	2010-12-30
A crime thriller that is good more of the time than it's not, but suffers from the fact it should've been great.	2010-12-25
A solid crime drama, with shades of Michael Mann's Heat, but a sluggish pace and meandering middle drag things down a little.	2010-12-24
... a well-tooled thriller with a tough edge and an impressive professionalism.	2010-12-21
The movie's thrills are old-fashioned and assured.	2010-12-17
Despite its gritty feel and appearance, it's a romantic heist picture at heart.	2010-12-12
The cast is uniformly game, restrained, earthy, and will probably prove superior to at least half of those nominated for Oscars next year.	2010-11-29
full review at Movies for the Masses	2010-11-20
Ben Affleck has matured as an actor and serves up what is arguably his best performance to date.	2010-11-19
...the familiarity of the storyline is rarely as problematic as one might've anticipated...	2010-11-06
En comparacion con su primer largo como director, este segundo intento de Ben Affleck pierde puntos no porque sea una mala pelicula, sino porque es una pelicula mas.	2010-11-02
One of the first serious adult dramas of the fall season, 'The Town' also is one of the first serious Oscar contenders.	2010-10-30
Disproving theories on the inability of male multitasking, Ben Affleck skilfully acts, writes and directs The Town.	2010-10-29
A hard-edged thriller with a soft underbelly that continues to solidify Ben Affleck's talents in front of, and behind the camera.	2010-10-25
As far as a developing directing talent goes, The Town is to Ben Affleck what Pulp Fiction was to Quentin Tarantino. It's that good.	2010-10-22
An electric heist film played out with an impressive ensemble cast, and grounded in a believably earnest sense of place, Affleck proves Gone Baby Gone was no beginner's luck.	2010-10-19
It turns that as a director [Affleck is] exemplary and probably should direct himself more often, as he's done a great job both in front of and behind the lens in this excellent heist film.	2010-10-17
In lesser hands, the central relationship might not have worked; but Affleck and Hall make it completely believable, adding to the texture of this classy thriller.	2010-10-15
Trouble is, The Town could have been a far better and more compelling movie with someone else as the star.	2010-10-15
One poor director's choice lets the film down badly. In the climactic closing scenes, there is just way, way too much fire power. A strong film nonetheless, much of the time.	2010-10-15
If you can imagine Clint Eastwood doing a stripped-back version of Michael Man's classic heist flick Heat, you are in the vicinity of what Ben Affleck has achieved with The Town.	2010-10-15
Richly rewarding and should be devoured by adult cinemagoers in a sea of mediocre titles at the multiplex.	2010-10-15
The tension is thick and the accents even thicker in the redemptive crime thriller, The Town.	2010-10-15
Best when focusing on robbing rather than knobbing... The Town is absorbing whenever the bad guys are up to no good.	2010-10-14
It's better than a simple heist movie and less efficient than a really good one. Affleck has made it about character and place, at the expense of the heist, so it's a film of mixed attractions.	2010-10-13
The Town is a decent crime thriller/drama but it has the veneer of a film with far more substance	2010-10-13
Affleck?s sophomore offering contains plenty of pay-offs and a slick narrative structure, easily solidifying his growing reputation as a director with the right stuff for a familiar good time.	2010-10-12
Featuring a highly impressive ensemble cast, this smart and stylish thriller is hugely entertaining.	2010-10-11
The emotional action in The Town is just as gripping as the physical action.	2010-10-09
Invested with some original ideas and a solid premise, The Town is a crunchy thriller	2010-10-09
There?s a rich sense of place in this taut thriller that begins as a heist movie before it swallows us up and takes us into different territory	2010-10-09
Affleck calls his own number, giving a strong turn as the conflicted criminal who thinks he might finally taste life without looking over his shoulder.	2010-10-08
Only now does it seem the older Affleck's career rehabilitation is fully complete with the arrival of his second accomplished directorial outing, The Town.	2010-10-06
Treats its stock dynamics and themes with respectful professionalism.	2010-10-05
Affleck brings this base, disturbing slice of Boston into focus.	2010-10-03
Affleck takes a number of risks, which helps elevate The Town above its admittedly pulpy roots into something that is both harder and more moving	2010-10-02
The Town is a steal. It's a tautly-paced, well-acted and confidently directed heist flick that cares as much about detailing the nuances of its characters' damaged lives as it does in executing the crew's big scores.	2010-10-01
It's a studio picture that offers intriguing situations and characters as well as the gunplay and car chases that dominate most Hollywood fare.	2010-10-01
The heist sequences and chase scenes are beautifully staged, although the romance seems unlikely and taints an otherwise solid action film.	2010-09-30
beautifully constructed film worthy of the praise it has received during its award season run	2013-10-14
Absolutely masterful in both its production and its performances, this drama is easily one of the year's best.	2013-06-30
You can know how this misdaventure came out and still be moved by this mystical/moving and miraculous film.	2013-01-27
127 Hours is an inspiring dramatic thriller with creative direction by Danny Boyle and a commanding performance from James Franco.	2012-10-05
127 Hours asks a big question of its audience: could you do what Aron Ralston does when it came down to it?	2012-09-28
It's chilling, claustrophobic, even nerve-racking, but it's also one of the most fascinating films of the year.	2012-09-22
With all due respect to Franco's strong performance, the director, Danny Boyle hijacked the story for a chance to show off his visual style.	2012-07-12
Boyle solves the problem of shooting a film in a single location	2012-04-15
... Essentially Franco in a one-man show, and his charm and enthusiasm instantly win us over.	2011-11-05
For a movie about a man falling into a canyon crack, there's much to think about here, not the least of which is how far any one of us would go, under similar circumstances, to survive.	2011-09-09
Danny Boyle is hit-or-miss for me. Thankfully, this was a hit.	2011-08-15
It's an incredible performance by Franco, walking the line between what once was enthusiasm but now is manic desperation.	2011-08-12
You'll feel like you're clenching everything in your body as this movie builds towards its inevitable climax, but this is a masterful work...	2011-06-15
A lot of movies about climbing &#8210; Touching the Void, North Face &#8210; are about men who get into trouble by pushing their luck. This one takes as its main theme the sin of hubris.	2011-05-05
This is an honest-to-goodness, feel-good triumphant scene -- albeit one that's disorienting and exhausting, somewhat as it must have been in real life.	2011-04-16
It's haunting and moving and -- if you're squeamish -- only involves major arm-cut-offing for like 60 seconds of screen time.	2011-04-04
Driven by James Franco's charisma and Danny Boyle's bizarrely antiquated, but refreshingly sharp sense of style, 127 Hours is as exciting as a film about a guy stuck to a rock could possibly be.	2011-03-23
...immaculate in its technical aspects, not just in the way the camera hunts down interesting images but in its pitch perfect casting and ... sound design. This is the sort of movie you admire more for its virtuosity than [its]story	2011-03-04
A tour de force for Franco, certainly, but also for Boyle, who takes something you'd think impossible to film and somehow makes a compelling story out of it.	2011-03-02
Danny Boyle makes you experience the ordeal in vivid, intimate details. You feel everything from the visceral agony to the utter triumph. It's brilliant movie-making	2011-03-01
Una atrapante e increible historia real de supervivencia, narrada por el director Danny Boyle con irregular imaginacion y dinamismo. Se sostiene sobre todo gracias a la excelente actuacion de James Franco.	2011-02-23
A estrategia visual tumultuada, embora torne a narrativa mais dinamica, eventualmente acaba tambem diluindo sua forca.	2011-02-19
You aren't always going to be comfortable when you watch '127 Hours.' But then you're not meant to be.	2011-02-12
True life story of a man stuck between a rock and a hard place tells of an appreciation of life while in the throes of death.	2011-02-12
127 Hours is ultimately about a man wrestling with his own hubristic mode of living, and paying a price for it, but living.	2011-02-10
It's really solid filmmaking and daring.	2011-02-10
As a follow-up to Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours shows Danny Boyle at the top of his form -- it's not a story many filmmakers would want to tackle, and few would handle it as well.	2011-02-10
Franco is amazingly good and deserves what is his first Academy Award nomination.	2011-02-10
That director Danny Boyle makes us feel the shock of relief as Ralston finally pulls away from his stony prison signals just how immersive a piece of first-person story-telling this is.	2011-02-09
The story of a man stuck under a rock somehow becomes a whirring, frantic flight of cinematic bluster - enjoyable, even exhilarating at times, but frustratingly at odds with how one imagines the actual experience must have been.	2011-02-09
Not only does Boyle's command of film style make 127 Hours an engaging experience, but it is also impressively used throughout the film to build and develop Ralston as a character.	2011-02-09
This tale of male bravado is tedious and tiring and that amputation moment is stomach churning.	2011-02-08
Boyle's film takes us back to the campfire for a story that is painful and powerful, as well as true.	2011-02-08
127 Hours represents a moment of Darwinism personified and Danny Boyle a filmmaker with his finger pressed firmly against the pulse of human potential.	2011-02-08
Don't let the violence put you off like it has with audiences in America, 127 Hours is a mountain of a film that is worth climbing.	2011-02-08
A thrilling and life-affirming journey driven by James Franco's gut-wrenching performance and Danny Boyle's exuberant direction.	2011-02-08
It doesn't matter how disarming Franco's single-handed performance is; there is simply not enough dramatic meat on the bones of Ralston's true story to distract us from where it is heading.	2011-02-08
The arc of this film is not of a man getting trapped and finally getting free. It's of a man who has been isolated from the world for far more than 127 hours, and finally calling out for 'help'.	2011-02-07
127 Hours is immersive cinema in the most gut wrenching sense.	2011-02-07
A film that etches into our psyche with its extraordinary elements	2011-02-06
Leads us to the edge - of humanity, sanity and to a place far beyond our comfort zone	2011-02-06
127 Hours may be more a social media-driven cinema stunt than story, but it has triumphant moments, transcendent imagery and Franco's Oscar-nominated performance.	2011-01-28
Worthwhile, but I would have preferred a less strenuous, more patient, less 'entertaining' production, without the hallucinated laugh track and the visions of Scooby-Doo...	2011-01-28
[James Franco]'s as good to this film as Tom Hanks was to the similar, superior Cast Away.	2011-01-28
Split screens, flashbacks, fantasy sequences, hallucinations, speed variations, helicopter shots and extreme reverse zooms are just a few weapons in [Boyle's] arsenal, but most potent of all is James Franco in the lead.	2011-01-27
The psychological and physiological effects of a desperate man are played to maximum effect.	2011-01-17
At its centre is a magnificent performance from James Franco...	2011-01-10
At the end, we stagger like Ralston from the dark into the light. We might have both our arms left, but our nerves are just as terrorised.	2011-01-10
The story lacks some suspense as the ending is known but Boyle compensates with a immersive drama, aided by some first-class camerawork. The ending is powerfully life-affirming.	2011-01-10
It is, like a lot of Boyle's work, weirdly life affirming, capturing without sentimentality what it means to get a second chance to connect with what's important in life.	2011-01-10
Extraordinary, astonishing, revealing, unique	2012-09-09
Truly inspiring	2012-09-09
The film is never flippant, never disrespectful and always approaches Mark's hobby with eyes wide open and no agenda other than fascinated admiration.	2012-09-08
Alternate realities help us work through issues, but might keep us from confronting the world	2011-09-30
By allowing his emerging post-trauma experience into his pretend kingdom, the man is reconstituting his self-consciousness, reclaiming the dignity of his whole mind, recovering his soul.	2011-08-20
First-time director Jeff Malmberg does almost everything right in this stunningly empathetic documentary.	2011-03-13
Marwencol provides a deeply empathetic view of loneliness and powerful evidence of art as an outlet.	2011-03-09
Speaks to the addictiveness, the catharsis, the unpredictability, and the eternity of the creative process.	2011-03-04
A heartwrenching tale of wish fulfillment on a nearly molecular level...	2011-03-02
Marwencol is a mesmerizing documentary, and like Mark Hogancamp it continually surprises you. It may also be one of the best films you'll see all year.	2011-02-10
Hogancamp didn't know he was creating art ... he was merely surviving, spinning stories for his sanity. In an era of 'look-at-me,' this type of agenda is as far away from our world as Marwencol itself.	2011-01-18
Cinematically raw, untidy and sometimes positively odd, but it's also revealing, fascinating, unsettling and ultimately quite touching.	2011-01-13
"Marwencol" is inspiring but also insightful because it refuses to gloss over complex, even discomfiting questions surrounding its endearing but troubled central character.	2011-01-06
Malmberg instead takes a gentle approach. He's patient and coaxing, and he lets Mark grow comfortable for the camera.	2011-01-04
Simultaneously hypnotic and unnerving, it asks some rather uncomfortable questions about the nature of art and the potential and limits of self-healing.	2010-12-28
Director Jeff Malmberg sees something in Hogancamp that he wants all of us to see, an imperfect human scarred by horrific trauma who nonetheless finds a reason to live.	2010-12-28
Enthralling and deeply strange.	2010-12-28
The film Marwencol is as mesmerizing as Mark's imaginary town and treats him and his world with absolute respect	2010-12-17
Hogancamp's alliance with director Jeff Malmberg in this artful and poignant film marks a victory in the war against the self.	2010-12-17
A painfully intimate, mysterious, joyous film.	2010-12-11
Director Jeff Malmberg documents Hogancamp's twin worlds with care and restraint; "Marwencol" is an example of how a documentary filmmaker can delve into the life of an eccentric person without exploiting them	2010-12-10
A fine, delicately nuanced portrait of an artist compelled by mysterious forces to create something utterly unique.	2010-12-10
Mark, who is on camera much of the time, comes across as an amiable burn-out case, primitivist, artist, obsessive childman, battered soul, horny guy, charming, weird and, by the way, a collector and wearer of women's high heels.	2010-12-02
If you have even a passing interest in outsider art, you owe it to yourself to see "Marwencol."	2010-12-02
The beauty of "Marwencol" is that, by the time it's over, wanting to live in a doll village doesn't sound so weird because we understand exactly where Hogancamp is coming from.	2010-12-02
Producer/director Jeff Malmberg tells the amazing true story with tenderness and tact.	2010-12-02
This is truly inspirational filmmaking.	2010-11-28
May be aesthetically rough around the edges but it nonetheless offers an empathetic view on a stunningly unique figure.	2010-11-26
...either an amazing example of self therapy through art or the most elaborate ploy to get laid ever. Then it gets really weird.	2010-11-19
Marwencol is about Hogancamp and his miniature alter-ego, about his photographs and his creative process. But it is also, on a deeper level, about how we process our experiences...	2010-11-18
What makes this documentary film interesting is the unique world Hogancamp creates to cope with his intense feelings of anger and loss over his near-fatal beating by five men.	2010-11-12
A celebration of the transformative power of art in coping with so many of the challenges people face -- healthcare problems, post-traumatic disorders, alternative lifestyles.	2010-11-11
Healing, art, and therapy live in a little town in Belgium	2010-11-11
What makes this an unusually strong film, is that there's an unquestionable genuineness about this tragic story about survival... .	2010-11-10
The film isn't a heavy reinforcement of shame, but a composed celebration of creativity, brought to life through the soap opera of toys, offering Mark the hero status he's always dreamed for himself.	2010-11-10
A haunting movie about a haunted man, Marwencol is a revelatory documentary which is already generating Oscar buzz.	2010-11-05
Outsider art has never seemed as riveting -- or as revealing -- as it does in Marwencol.	2010-11-05
Marwencol is truly a wonderful town. Because Mark Hogancamp puts incredible detail into the appearance of each doll, everything seems so real!	2010-10-16
In the end, Marwencol is a fascinating portrait of a reinvented mind, rather than one of those all-American tales of triumph over adversity.	2010-10-13
This tender documentary considers the mysteries of both art and coping.	2010-10-13
Utterly compelling portrait of a singular artist and survivor.	2010-10-11
Malmberg has a higher aim, one that transcends his individual subject.	2010-10-08
Woven together by Jeff Malmberg -- if not seamlessly, then with illuminating patience -- these disparate strands honor an individual as unique as the miniature universe on which he depends.	2010-10-08
Marwencol" poses penetrating questions -- about art, outsider status, the mysteries of the human brain and the possibility of second chances -- all while circling, ever closer, an unforgettable individual and the unknowable creative impulse.	2010-10-08
First-time director Jeff Malmberg tells Hogancamp's fascinating story with sensitivity, never resorting to exploitation.	2010-10-08
Jeff Malmberg's documentary does an amazing job of turning this small patch of dollhouses into a vibrant world of its own, utilizing Hogancamp's own extraordinary pictures of Marwencol's inhabitants to great effect.	2010-10-06
This is outsider art in its finest, most unsettling expression.	2010-10-05
Malmberg uses his imagination as well in telling this story, with its resonating nuances about the meaning of art and identity, but Hogancamp's modest genius and his incredible creation transcend the confines of outsider art.	2010-10-05
A must-see.	2010-10-05
An astounding movie one of those tales of all-American oddness that just keeps flowering into weirder, richer territory.	2010-10-05
We're shown real life problems in a fictional story that gives us real life solutions. Bravo Lisa, your film is more than all right.	2013-08-28
Bening hoists this heavy-handed dramedy high with a burst of superhuman strength. And all you can do is sit in awe.	2013-05-25
A twist on the traditional family drama, where every character has depth and deserves redemption.	2011-08-15
The dialog seems like it was pulled from a magazine full of bad liberal cliches. It feels as if people who used to be progressives, but want people to think they still are wrote this movie.	2011-02-27
This is very tricky material to parse, mainly because the movie is telling us one thing in dialogue and showing us quite another visually.	2011-02-23
What it lacks in grandstanding and pandering to the 'issues', this film more than makes up for with its great story, rounded characters and genuine sense of fun.	2011-02-01
The Kids Are All Right is witty, touching and humane - and decidedly up to the minute.	2011-01-31
Its emotional pull remains consistent to the end.	2011-01-31
More of a breezy drama, as opposed to a weighty comedy... the ace up its sleeve, aside from its "modern family" plot device, is its characters, brought to life with welcome layers and depth by the cast.	2011-01-18
How, despite such a talented, femme-centric cast, does Ruffalo's loveable idiot manage to walk off with the film?	2011-01-11
Regardless of the orientations, 'The Kids Are All Right' is an all-American film.	2011-01-03
The Kids Are All Right would have been a highly regarded, stinging family drama in the tradition of American Beauty and Ordinary People even if the subject family was not so proudly unorthodox.	2010-12-30
A bittersweet family dramedy that challenges the perceptions of the perfect family...	2010-12-19
The combined troupe do a good enough job to make the movie get by, but not enough to mask the huge gears running the story, nor the accidental and ironic anti-progressiveness the movie has the potential to convey.	2010-12-10
A long-form sitcom overly pleased with its own progressiveness.	2010-11-26
...All the pieces are in place--I just wish Cholodenko had been a little more precious about the execution.	2010-11-24
Without any humor in the story, this would be a very sad story about a destructive mix of personalities causing havoc in a family. But the film does have a lot of humor in it.	2010-11-24
full review at Movies for the Masses	2010-11-20
Una sensible comedia dramatica sobre la falta de certezas (o la eterna busqueda de ellas) que implica formar una familia, mas alla de definiciones y preferencias sexuales. Excelente elenco en el que brilla especialmente Annette Bening.	2010-11-16
if it wasn't for the distractingly wall-to-wall indie soundtrack... and mildly cop-out ending, I'd be pushing this straight to the top end of our Best of 2010 list.	2010-11-14
The Kids Are All Right is warmly recommended to anyone in search of smart, grown-up entertainment.	2010-11-08
A sleek, smart, enormously entertaining film, (....) it has the feel of a classic Hollywood comedy at its snappiest.	2010-11-06
A light, lovingly handled tale about the difficulties of staying in love.	2010-11-03
The film joyfully allows us to embrace, rather than escape, the wonderful, awkward embarrassment of familial love.	2010-11-02
The film taps into the neuroses of middle-class America without exploiting its premise for egregious quirk value or for dry, tub-thumping agenda-setting.	2010-11-01
Only those without a funnybone will fail to be seduced by its sheer verve, wit and charm.	2010-10-29
This is a much better made, more persuasive film than The Switch or The Back-Up Plan but just as much about wish fulfilment, and no more honest about conflicts that can leave the kids far from all right.	2010-10-29
Piercingly funny, subtle and moving.	2010-10-29
Funny, aching, rueful -- often at the same time -- The Kids Are All Right makes most mainstream releases this year seem decadent by comparison.	2010-10-28
An intelligent, well observed movie about adult relationships. The kids are alright but this is a film for grown ups.	2010-10-28
Films about the stresses and strains of marriage don't come any better -- or more entertaining -- than this.	2010-10-28
The film gets better and better, powered by a sharp, wise script and superlative acting.	2010-10-28
Family-centric comedy has never felt so fresh.	2010-10-28
A witty portrait of postmodern family life in which script, casting, direction and location all just float together without any apparent effort at all.	2010-10-28
Best of all is Bening, capping even her performance in American Beauty, as a woman forced to face her partner's betrayal.	2010-10-28
Smart, funny, slyly satirical and wonderfully warm, this deft 'dramedy' is bitter-sweet film-making at its best.	2010-10-28
A witty, warm exploration of family life that's conventional and unconventional in equal measure.	2010-10-27
There are good performances and a smart and occasionally funny script, plus some good observations about relationships, but you do wonder what the point is to it all.	2010-10-27
So much tension doesn't quite translate into a gutsy finale, still, this film is never less than heartfelt.	2010-10-27
it is a miracle of mainstreaming - but in making her film just like any other family drama, Cholodenko also risks bringing a certain generic blandness to her 'unconventional family'. Perhaps that is the acceptable price of equality...	2010-10-27
Hugely entertaining, frequently funny and genuinely moving, this is a sharply written comedy-drama with refreshingly original characters and terrific performances from all five leads.	2010-10-26
The Critics Are All Wrong.	2010-10-24
Five of this year's best screen characters appear in this comedy-drama about a relatively ordinary family facing some unusual challenges. And while the premise seems extremely offbeat, it's actually beside the point.	2010-10-24
There are few films as soulful and human as Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right. That a film can set itself apart from the pack by merely being human is somewhat depressing, but there you have it.	2010-10-21
A smart, funny, insightful take on the dynamics of Modern Families. It taps into both the universal and specific dynamics of the family unit. Bening gives a career best performance.	2010-09-08
The Kids are All Right is funny, touching and honest, all the elements that make independent cinema so much more rewarding, most of the time, than the mainstream.	2010-09-07
The Kids Are All Right is a film about marriage, family and parenthood and it explores these themes with far more integrity, insight and humour than many other films.	2010-09-05
This is a witty and insightful film. Lisa Cholodenko has a talent for observational comedy; comedies which capture the zeitgeist, usually achieved by throwing together people with two different sets of expectations.	2010-09-03
Common to all Cholodenko's films is a fascination with the mayhem that can result when the chronically stitched-up come up against the amoral and fancy-free.	2010-09-03
The Kids Are All Right gets at basic, underlying truths, and opens them up with both sly humour and brittle neediness. Lisa Cholodenko has found her home.	2010-09-02
its most emotionally raw moments are indicative of their military subjects' exceptional comfort level with their observers ( ... ) the arid yet woody outcroppings high above the valley are an intriguing new terrain	2013-11-13
Restrepo succeeds as both a remarkable piece of cinema verite documentary filmmaking and a tribute to the soldiers who are put through hell.	2011-02-20
Restrepo captures the physical trauma and psychological torment that forms the essence of the 'War is Hell' mantra, regardless of which flag you fight under.	2011-02-07
Everything about the way this film is shot, edited and packaged scream of a desire to show the war exactly as it is.	2011-02-01
Restrepo avoids political discussion. It just revels in the heroism of these impossibly young, brave soldiers who follow orders that at times seem pointless because following them is what their country has asked them to do.	2011-01-31
Though the movie tries not to make any kind of commentary, it's clear: this is just another reminder as to the utter pointlessness of this war.	2011-01-27
"Restrepo" puts a new face on the war in Afghanistan. A decidedly American face. Paul Chambers, CNN.	2011-01-26
Reminds us that wars are fought by individuals, not faceless armies.	2010-12-28
Despite being a moving reminder to support our troops, Restrepo cannot help but be "Exhibit A" in the case against the unwinnable "War on Terror."	2010-12-26
Restrepo comes closest of any film I've seen to fully suggesting what being a soldier is like.	2010-11-26
The madness of warfare is starkly presented here, as dozens of questions potentially run through the viewer's mind.	2010-11-22
Despite disclaimers by the directors that this is not a "political" movie, "Restrepo" is one damned good reason to get the hell out of Afghanistan NOW.	2010-11-15
With daredevil camera work and a real empathy for soldiers, this documentary film makes you feel like you are inside a G.I.'s uniform in Afghanistan's Korangal Valley.	2010-10-20
[Achieves] level of visceral intensity that rivals the jacked-up, heart-in-mouth tension that was previously the preserve of the best fiction film-makers.	2010-10-18
Captures the complex human face of modern warfare.	2010-10-12
A film that effectively captures the camaraderie, chaos and complexity of soldiers doing their best to win the "hearts and minds" of the local population.	2010-10-11
It provides an admiring look at the brave soldiers eager to do the mission and return alive.	2010-10-10
If the only message you get out of "Restrepo" is that war is all hell, then the documentary has done its job. But if a viewer equates being pro-soldier with being pro-war, then the point of this movie has been missed.	2010-10-09
It's all strong stuff, and about as far removed from a traditional Hollywood all strong stuff, and as far removed additional Hollywood war movie as you can get.	2010-10-08
Restrepo is an exercise in visceral intimacy.	2010-10-08
Built around hand-held reportage, the film passes no judgement on the rightness or otherwise of the occupation. But the sense of bewilderment and futility speaks for itself.	2010-10-07
It is a scary, moving and troubling film.	2010-10-07
Film doesn't get more relevant.	2010-10-07
Deservedly taking the documentary prize at Sundance, this details a conflict that seems to have no purpose other than to scar those caught up in it.	2010-10-07
Powerful, terrifying and soulful, this real-life Hurt Locker is an intimate, often brilliant insight into combat and comradeship.	2010-10-06
The camera lingers on the soldiers' smiles and tears and shows the human face of military tactics which reduce people to chess pieces.	2010-10-06
Restrepo gazes unflinchingly on those at the heart of a contentious conflict and renders their experience viscerally and -- most importantly -- humanely.	2010-10-06
First-rate stuff.	2010-10-06
It's hard to watch the film without feeling a deep empathy for these guys, partly because they relate to the camera like it's a comrade, not an intruder.	2010-09-15
The footage Junger and Hetherington got is an incredible, boots-on-the-ground, soldier's-eye view of combat.	2010-09-10
The results are uncomfortable and occasionally harrowing in their realism -- and utterly compelling.	2010-09-09
To say that the experience is powerful is putting it mildly.	2010-09-02
At this point in all our Middle Eastern conflicts, we need more from a documentary than just a grunts-eye-view of the frustrating nature of the war.	2010-08-23
A remarkable piece of documentary cinema. Not only does it do Pfc. Restrepo proud, but it brings home the fog of war more powerfully than any other movie in recent memory.	2010-08-20
The film provides insight into the soldiers and their environment, but it is its own paradox: The more it reveals, the more mysterious and puzzling the war becomes.	2010-08-20
An unvarnished and unwavering look at 21st-century combat.	2010-08-19
The film's depiction is honest, but showcasing anything more engaging or important proves elusive.	2010-08-13
...in some ways the most harrowing film I've ever seen	2010-08-13
The directors were satisfied with telling us about a group of courageous, honorable young soldiers -- a salute these men richly deserve.	2010-08-12
Riveting, harrowing doc shows the war we ignore	2010-08-12
This fantastic first-hand account gives new meaning to the slogan "support the troops." Viewers will not soon forget the distinctive sounds of live ammunition being fired.	2010-08-06
This documentary from writer Sebastian Junger will leave audiences with a new admiration for what fighting men must endure.	2010-08-06
A look at both the tragic folly of war and the camaraderie of men under pressure, the documentary Restrepo holds both hope and horror.	2010-08-06
In hewing closely to the rhythms of war, Junger and Hetherington forgo different considerations about war.	2010-08-06
If that intimate access had been married to a stronger narrative structure, Restrepo might have been a great film instead of just a collection of striking moments.	2010-08-04
Restrepo is a bracing difference from the neatly packaged accounts that mainstream media coverage typically provides. You don't have to be a hawk or a dove to appreciate its unvarnished honesty.	2010-08-04
Directors Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger have come up with one of the most direct, searing documentaries in the history of US war in the Middle East.	2010-08-02
An example of photojournalism at its finest.	2010-07-30
This isn't the movies. It's life.	2010-07-30
Sebastian Junger's chronicle of a fourteen-month mission in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley isn't much of a documentary, but the undeniably harrowing footage should be required viewing.	2010-07-29
The characters are as compelling as you will see in anything else. Banksy is his own antihero of the film, and Guetta is fascinating to watch in his obsessive glory.	2014-01-05
Banksy exposes the con-job that is modern art for what it is.	2013-01-29
Whatever your view of Britain's most famous street artist, prepare to be teased, provoked and possibly enraged by the release of his first movie.	2012-08-02
Just as clever as the work of Sasha Baron Cohen, but not nearly as culturally worthwhile because it is not nearly as politically candid.	2012-07-12
An irritatingly misguided and pointless piece of work...	2011-07-22
Too ironic by half, this film is hobbled most of all by principal Thierry Guetta, that I find insufferably banal. As a satire on a market-driven art world, it is fairly toothless. Why it has garnered rave reviews is the biggest puzzle of all.	2011-05-01
Energetic, exciting, entertaining, and at times illegal, Exit Through The Gift Shop is a wicked treat.	2011-04-05
Those tricky questions that lie in the chasm between art and commerce are raised naturally through the progression of the narrative, whether that narrative is partially fabricated or not.	2011-03-06
Curious docu about street artists with some strong language.	2011-02-01
Since virtually anything can be considered art, the term has become virtually meaningless. This documentary proves it.	2010-12-31
The behind-the-scenes insight into the techniques of illegal street art is fascinating, as is the art-market critique..	2010-12-30
Illustrates how our insistence and abilities in judging and evaluating art are often arbitrary, contradictory, and idiotic.	2010-12-29
It's funny, playful, and intriguing in a way that makes me want to see it again.	2010-12-24
After all those debates about the meaning of art ... [who] would have thought that the best and most incisive comments on the argument would have come from street-punk Banksy?	2010-10-21
Regardless of its motives, Gift Shop is a superb work, one that demands the audience ask questions that don't always go down easily...	2010-09-30
A strange oxymoron of a film, like a straight-faced Spinal Tap or a Man On Wire for liars.	2010-09-05
The street artist known as Banksy is witty, he's smart, he's subversive -- and he's compelling. So it stands to reason that the street-art doc he ostensibly hijacked would be all those things, too.	2010-08-02
Confused yet? Good. Banksy probably wants you exactly that way.	2010-07-06
The plain fact is that, on some level, it doesn't matter whether the film is true or not. Either way, it's fascinating. Either way, we learn a lot. Either way, it's a great film.	2010-06-24
A provocative and absorbing exploration of what constitutes art, the creative process and the power of hype to triumph over talent.	2010-06-23
Exit Through the Gift Shop is a film that needs to be seen to be disbelieved.	2010-06-21
Either way [as documentary or hoax], the movie speaks the truth about the phoniness and self-adulation of the art world %u2014 which makes it not only fascinating but essential.	2010-06-19
Can we trust a director/tour guide who appears only in shadow with an electro-scrambled voice like one of those "60 Minutes" mob informant interviews? Yes!	2010-06-17
The only thing that may keep "Exit Through the Gift Shop" from winning the Oscar next year for best documentary is that it may be totally untrue. Aside from that, it's a shoo-in.	2010-06-04
Exit Through the Gift Shop is an exhilarating and bewildering experience but like the transient art form that it is expressing, that's sort of the point.	2010-06-03
Is Exit Through the Gift Shop a real documentary or an expert hoax? Does it really matter as long as you're laughing and thinking?	2010-05-28
Is Banksy's film the next great thing in documentary filmmaking? Or are we all on the business end of an admittedly pretty good joke? You decide.	2010-05-26
Be it documentary or mockumentary, art of graffiti, there's no denying that Exit Through the Gift Shop is damn good cinema.	2010-05-22
Like the better pieces of the art it showcases, an oddity worth experiencing.	2010-05-20
...offers 90 minutes of pretty good entertainment. The fact that it may well be just one more stunt by an artist known for stunts doesn't detract in the least from the enjoyment.	2010-05-17
It's endlessly arguable and open for debate. At the very least, we can all agree that Banksy has found a new wall on which to plaster his art -- that of the silver screen.	2010-05-14
The characters and events are extraordinary enough to keep you entertained with ironies and hypotheses.	2010-05-13
Is he playing us? You bet. And quite beautifully. What's exquisite about this romp of a film is figuring out just how much of a mug he's making of us.	2010-05-13
As the documentary morphs into a riddle about art in the marketplace, the eyes of the beholder get crossed, and the dizziness is part of the fun.	2010-05-13
Real or manufactured, Banksy's film is a triumphant deconstruction of the commercial bastardization of art.	2010-05-09
Either a postmodernist critique of mainstream art or the cheekiest promo flick ever made	2010-05-07
It's a cynical statement, but a statement nonetheless.	2010-05-07
Hoax or not, Exit Through the Gift Shop ends up energizing, aggravating, enjoyable and revealing. Is it art or isn't it? Who knows? Apparently no one.	2010-05-07
Put-on, satire, mockumentary, goof? Whatever it is, "Exit Through the Gift Shop" is an original.	2010-05-07
Like Banksy's best street work, it pushes and prods our gullibility buttons and sends the mind swirling with questions of artistic authenticity and intent.	2010-05-07
A treatise on Bad Art and a screed against tone-deaf patterns of consumption that drive trends in the art world.	2010-05-03
Even if you are not a fan of street art, this documentary will make you both laugh and teach you that original film making is still out there!	2010-04-30
Exit Through the Gift Shop offers an absorbing glimpse of a bracingly subversive slice of the culture, as well as some tantalizing images of Banksy at work.	2010-04-30
Exit Through the Gift Shop is inspiring, subversive and thrilling.	2010-04-30
Exit Through the Gift Shop, credited as "A Banksy Film," poses some bitingly funny questions about the meaning and value of art. Is it in the eye of the beholder? Is it truth plus beauty? Anything you can get away with? Brainwashing?	2010-04-29
Some have suggested that the whole story, including the emergence of Mr. Brainwash, is an elaborate hoax engineered by Banksy to satirize the commodification of art. If so, it's a brilliant one.	2010-04-29
Questions abound, but regardless of the verisimilitude of the film, it is highly entertaining.	2010-04-29
The brilliantly untrustworthy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop reminds us that a film can start out in one direction and then change course so radically, it becomes an act of provocation unto itself.	2010-04-29
The widespread speculation that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a hoax only adds to its fascination.	2010-04-29
Fascinating.	2010-04-26
Peyton Place meets Deliverance in a meth lab.	2012-07-11
In moments of confrontation [Jennifer Lawrence's Ree] is as fearsome as Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, taking on monsters to protect the small and the vulnerable.	2012-06-12
Jennifer Lawrence is dazzling as the film's protagonist as she struggles to uncover the truth between her addict father's disappearance.	2011-08-15
Winter's Bone is an absorbing and socially conscious piece of work, underwritten by the constant threat of violence.	2011-06-30
Gritty and real...	2011-05-21
Granik... proves a dab hand with the camera, capturing the starkness of the Ozarks and Ree's situation in a free-flowing and pensive way that transfers the chill of it all on to the screen.	2011-05-18
Not having been to this part of the country, I can't say for sure whether Granik has captured it accurately. The point is that it feels genuine.	2011-04-04
Granik pays deference to the curious ways of the mountain folk, rejecting the prevailing hillbilly cliches to depict people with hardy survival instincts in the grip of financial hardship and addiction.	2011-03-30
An unflinching portrait of shabby life in the Ozarks, this powerful indie drama features an Oscar-caliber turn from Jennifer Lewis, a real discovery who's only 20, in the lead.	2011-03-26
Winter's Bone certainly has its redeeming qualities, particularly its cinematography and a superb lead performance by Jennifer Lawrence, but man, does it feel EMPTY until a gripping sequence near the end.	2011-03-13
An acutely gripping, grimly authentic thriller.	2011-03-10
full review at Movies for the Masses	2011-02-24
Un retrato realista, crudo y duro de ambientes y personajes que viven al margen de la sociedad, de la ley y la moral, y que crece en intensidad como un thriller de suspenso. Estupendas actuaciones de Jennifer Lawrence y John Hawkes.	2011-02-19
Uma narrativa densa e multifacetada que permite que aquelas pessoas desafiem nossos preconceitos e se apresentem como individuos imperfeitos, sim, mas jamais unidimensionais.	2011-02-14
There is a profound sense of Neorealism percolating beneath Winter's Bone's noirish mystery plot.	2011-02-10
Debra Granik's bleak little film is as tough, unflinching and fascinating as the characters who eke out a life amid its cold, gray hills.	2011-01-31
... consciously attempting to avoid cliches can erode authenticity. To director Debra Granik's credit, realism permeates every frame of digital imagery	2011-01-28
A gripping movie that graphically portrays poverty as the worst form of violence in the life of a 17-year-old heroine struggling to save her family.	2010-12-29
Winter's Bone is boosted by a stellar cast of characters who engender both scares and occasional sympathy.	2010-12-25
Winter's Bone is as quiet as a snake. It's a chilling and challenging visit into a remote -- perhaps alien -- world. But while Winter's Bone has anguish and fear, the film is ultimately life-affirming and real.	2010-12-16
A masterpiece, and a gem worthy of Oscar gold...	2010-11-30
It's the kind of movie that pulls you into its setting and doesn't let go.	2010-11-17
A rewarding, richly detailed exploration of the strength of character required when confronted by ugly truths.	2010-11-17
...a deeply naturalistic brand of high lonesome noir.	2010-11-16
From the moment you meet Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in Winter's Bone, you know what she's capable of.	2010-11-11
A Southern teen navigates dangerous blood ties, and a new star emerges in the revelatory thriller Winter's Bone.	2010-11-11
Winter's Bone is indeed harrowing, but it is also fun. It's fun, because it's excellent, and after enduring the mostly-disappointing Hollywood blockbuster season, simply seeing an exquisite piece of work such as this brings a smile to my face.	2010-11-08
As Ree, 20-year-old Lawrence is an absolute revelation; her performance easily ranks amongst this year's best.	2010-11-06
The tone and the mood are consistent, the wintry setting forbidding, the characters silhouettes in a world of lean survival. It's the kind of filmmaking that shows off the talents of all concerned	2010-11-06
A tough tale of survival in a harsh environment, this adaptation echoes through the emotional chill and connects with us	2010-11-06
[Debra] Granik's rich sense of place and culture has the convincing detail of authenticity, and it avoids any sentimentality of Southern rural poverty or kin loyalty.	2010-11-04
These spooky woods are a dangerous setting - here we find desperate, brain-dead trailer-trash, with moral centres as hollow as the burnt out shacks of their meth misadventures.	2010-10-28
If the film lacks a certain pinch of mesmerizing drama, it makes up the difference with an exquisite lived-in quality. A frightening, yet crookedly poetic realism.	2010-10-24
A chilling reflection of nature's darker side.	2010-10-22
A Chilling look at American Poverty.	2010-10-01
The Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou? was the last film to make such delirious use of mountain music. The rest of the world can start drooling over Lawrence. I'm gonna git me a copy of that soundtrack.	2010-09-22
The film continues to grow in the memory months after it was first seen which is always a sign of something great.	2010-09-20
Movies don't come much duller than this.	2010-09-17
The film, adapted by director Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, establishes a formidable tension between mystery and matter-of-factness.	2010-09-17
There is poetry here -- as artists as diverse as Walker Evans, James Agee and Harry Smith have found -- of the rawest, most desperate kind.	2010-09-16
A sparse, engaging film perhaps easier to respect than love, but by any measure hugely compelling.	2010-09-16
It is all given unironic dignity and power due to the outstanding lead performance from 20-year-old Jennifer Lawrence as Ree, a young woman who must take on some scary neighbourhood types to protect her family.	2010-09-16
It will wow anyone who thinks grimness equals profundity.	2010-09-16
Think a film like Trash Humpers offers insight into a crappy life in the poor South? Winter's Bone will make you see the light.	2010-09-16
Lawrence's mature and inspiring determination makes this much, much more than a grim skid-row whodunnit.	2010-09-16
With a face as impassively beautiful as the landscape she trudges through, Ree Dolly is a heroine you won't forget. Tenacious and stoic, she holds her own in a vernacular that's equal parts hillbilly and hard-boiled.	2010-09-16
A vivid reworking of Daniel Woodrell's novel that brings the book's conflicted heroine to searing life in a piece of unhurried filmmaking too rarely seen these days.	2010-09-15
Granik balances the pace and intrigue of a mystery thriller with total compassion for Ree, played with much skill by Lawrence.	2010-09-15
Director Debra Granik has captured a female performance of such rare, career-defining intensity that the film actually has a life-affirming effect.	2010-09-15
Winter's Bone is a rewarding watch that does repay a fairly slow-moving narrative with heightened tension and twists at the end.	2010-09-15
Even those who have found Herzog's work lacking in the past will have a hard time writing off Cave of Forgotten Dreams. It's a superb film.	2013-11-11
Fascinating artworks by early man, sure, but they're let down by Herzog's long, rambling soliloquies about the history of homosapiens, albino crocodiles, and Baywatch... These sequences would have been right at home in a 45-minute IMAX film.	2013-09-08
Another lovely stanza in the epic poem of humanity that Herzog has been writing for half a century.	2013-01-08
Es indudable la capacidad del director por intentar, a traves de la camara, lo mismo que intentaron aquellos hombres y mujeres del Paleolitico unos 30.000 anos atras: comunicarse, expresar sentimientos y emociones, crear belleza.	2012-04-23
... captures the space, the texture, the quality of color of these ghost-like paintings, like shadows of the past captured on the cave walls.	2011-11-30
Confirmation, if any was needed, that culture and civilization existed 25,000 years ago and that we have gone downhill since the introduction of private property.	2011-11-29
These images of what the world was increase my sense of awe at what the world is.	2011-11-25
Werner Herzog's exploration of the miraculous Chauvel Cave comes with it evidence that human kind is indeed wired to believe in the hypnotic and poignant Cave of Forgotten Dreams.	2011-10-02
Cave of Forgotten Dreams is one of Herzog's most memorable films. Its subject, the 32,000-year-old drawings on the wall of the Chauvet Cave in southern France, is so astonishing that even Herzog's amiable sidetracks can't destroy the wonder.	2011-09-23
There is nothing gimmicky about Herzog's use of 3D in Cave of Forgotten Dreams. The depth of field afforded by the 3D format gives the viewer an uncanny spatial awareness of the site.	2011-09-22
Herzog has used the 3D process with tremendous creativity to make this very beautiful film.	2011-09-21
This is what 3-D was made for, puncturing the proscenium and taking us somewhere ''not yet offended''.	2011-09-21
Making superb use of the 3-D, and marked by Werner Herzog's idiosyncratic sensibilities, this contains enough captivating moments to make it a must-see.	2011-09-21
What is astonishing about the (32,000 year old) drawings discovered in the Chauvet Caves ... in southern France is that they look much like the drawings of competent contemporary art students	2011-09-18
It's hard not to think of Han Solo's neck unnaturally shifting to dodge a CG bullet as French archaeologists gape in awe at the beautiful untouched works created by Homo sapiens past	2011-09-12
To puzzle over these questions with Herzog makes for a singular and rapturous viewing experience.	2011-09-09
If this really is the last time anyone will be allowed to shoot inside of this archeological marvel, I can't help but feel that it was something of a waste.	2011-08-15
This nature and art documentary by Werner Herzog delivers an astonishingly privileged look at a subterranean time capsule.	2011-08-13
Cave of Forgotten Dreams is a 30,000-year leap of faith. Werner Herzog, after tiptoeing through the transforming cave, says, "Nothing is real. Nothing is certain." As an artist, he seems to like it that way.	2011-08-05
...might have been a worthy film at 60 minutes long, but then it wouldn't have been a Herzog film. The difference is the difference between a film about art, and a film that is art.	2011-07-24
What you see in the film is awe-inspiring.	2011-07-08
It is our tour guide that makes Cave of Forgotten Dreams an often thrilling experience.	2011-07-08
A hypnotic documentary that brings the incredible walls of the Chauvet Pont d'Arc cave to us as if we were standing 4 feet away from them.	2011-07-08
The overall effect, aided by Ernst Reijseger's score of rising choral harmonies and lush strings, is rapturous.	2011-07-07
A dazzling visual work.	2011-06-20
With his deadpan delivery, heavy German accent and even heavier Germanic existentialism, Herzog has become one of the most welcome, preposterous and even funny figures in current cinema.	2011-06-17
...the beauty of the pre-history artwork, available onscreen for want of any other alternative, is the wonder here, beyond film and ego.	2011-06-17
What is cinema but shadows dancing on walls?	2011-06-16
Art and history as seen through the eyes and mind of perhaps the most idiosyncratic filmmaker of all time.	2011-06-15
They emerged with a film that is supposed to be an art documentary, but is really a kind of immersive fever dream and time machine.	2011-06-14
Spectacular and absorbing,coinciding with the publication of Jean Auel's "The Land of Painted Caves."	2011-06-01
We're lucky to have it.	2011-05-27
Always the philosopher, Herzog is not content to simply document what is inside the cave. Rather, he uses the images as a launching point for a series of essentially unanswerable questions	2011-05-26
A haunting, evocative work...the rare film about art that can be considered a serious work of art itself.	2011-05-26
Herzog's glimpses of the future can be as otherworldly and singular as his perspective on the past.	2011-05-20
We will likely never be able to see this amazing place in person. Thanks to Herzog for giving us the next best thing.	2011-05-20
...equally intrigued by the prehistoric painters of yesteryear and those who study their work today.	2011-05-19
Cave of Forgotten Dreams transcends all conventional applications of 3-D filming and projection to record the oldest show on earth.	2011-05-12
[M]ay be the first absolutely essential 3D movie, one that you must see in 3D to appreciate its full potency...	2011-05-10
strongest sequences occur while simply viewing the paintings without narration	2011-05-09
In the end, the 3D is a distraction; I'd prefer more off-the-wall mini-profiles of odd characters, like the circus juggler turned palaeontologist, to tracking shots of stalactites backed by a chanting soundtrack.	2011-05-07
It's impossible to overstate the beauty of the Chauvet paintings: horses, rhinos, bison, and many other species flow around the curved walls of the caves...	2011-05-06
Herzog's documentary on the wondrous Cave of Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc is a true dazzler in the dark.	2011-05-06
The art on display in Cave of Forgotten Dreams is so jaw-droppingly beautiful that it can move a viewer to tears.	2011-05-06
Herzog brings 3D to the art-house documentary crowd	2011-05-06
When he stays quiet and we're privileged to spend time with these 30,000-year-old works, "Cave" is magical.	2011-05-06
Herzog and cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger have documented a natural wonder of the world that most of us will never see in person but thanks to Cave of Forgotten Dreams now have the opportunity to experience in a manner that's almost as good.	2011-05-06
Would have been better as a 30-minute special.	2011-05-06
To call "Cave of Forgotten Dreams" a great movie isn't just an understatement, it's a wildly inaccurate way to describe an experience that, in its immersive sensory pleasures and climactic journey of discovery, more closely resembles an ecstatic trance.	2011-05-06
This is something more than a movie; it's a testament - and re-creation - of rapture.	2011-05-06
a new and uniquely disturbing perspective on the Shoah	2013-11-13
Riveting, scary, and significant, Film Unfinished contrasts invaluable footage of agit-prop Nazi feature with the reaction of Warsaw Gehtto survivors to that footage and testimonies of the real life thee.	2012-09-09
Painful, eye-opening, and extraordinarily necessary to view, especially by the young to whom the Holocaust is nowadays too abstract a notion to fully mentally envision in all of its grotesqueness	2011-03-22
A heartbreaking but engrossing detective story that not only shines a light on Nazi evil but on the manipulative prowess of the Third Reich.	2011-03-18
The more it strips itself to the evidence... the more devastating and affecting the portrait becomes.	2011-03-10
An electrifying essay on film's ability to falsify history.	2011-03-03
Filmmaker Yael Hersonski reshapes the impossibly vile and tragic source material into a devastating record of Nazi criminality.	2011-01-04
...a very powerful documentary and first feature by Yael Hersonski.	2010-12-13
Hersonski brings something both old and new to the table with this powerful 89-minute documentary. Other strengths are the well-written narration read by Rona Keenan and the haunting original music of composer Yishai Adar.	2010-12-11
A Film Unfinished is a sort of ghost story. It's guaranteed to haunt you.	2010-12-10
Examination of Nazi inhumanity by an Israeli director on record as opposing Zionist inhumanity.	2010-12-06
It's impossible to watch A Film Unfinished and not feel haunted by the restless ghosts of history and those who tried -- and failed -- to use film to tell a lie.	2010-12-03
...analysis, clarification and a counterbalancing - if not outright refutation - of the persistent, nasty myth of Jewish collaboration in the Holocaust.	2010-12-03
Yael Hersonski's documentary is infuriating, heartbreaking, devastating -- and scary. It depicts a lie upon a lie.	2010-12-02
Yael Hersonski's A Film Unfinished reclaims history, teaches a lesson about the reliability of images and raises unanswerable questions about complicity.	2010-11-24
Moviegoers have witnessed dozens of depictions of these events over the years, but here we can see what it's like to view them with the eyes of real experience.	2010-11-11
A searing expose of the brutality of the Nazi regime ironically made by the perpetrators themselves, and a subtle examination of the process and purpose that lay behind it.	2010-11-05
The title also refers to Hersonski's own picture, part of a continuing saga that will never be finished as long as there are more Holocaust stories to expose.	2010-11-05
A remarkable new documentary that reminds us of film's inherent capacity for lying.	2010-11-04
A Film Unfinished reminds you that the nightmare of the Holocaust knows no limits.	2010-11-04
A flawed but hard-to-shake doc of one of mankind's greatest acts of inhumanity	2010-10-22
You look into the faces of these doomed souls and you see eternity -- and not the pretty, heavenly kind.	2010-10-22
The movie feels both ill-advised with its Errol Morris-like recreations of those German filmmakers who were commissioned to make an anti-Semitic "documentary" and absolutely necessary as it examines Hitler's insecurity about his own decisions.	2010-10-15
Discovered after the war, the film contains horrific images of starvation, poverty and humiliation, interspersed with surreal scenes of well-dressed Jews enjoying a restaurant dinner or an urban stroll.	2010-10-14
A Film Unfinished is a profoundly unnerving historical document.	2010-10-14
For serious Holocaust junkies only.	2010-10-01
What we are left with is perhaps one of the most disturbing 60 minutes of raw footage ever put together.	2010-09-30
An important historical document of a phony historical document. Truly unforgettable.	2010-09-30
The result is a harrowing, unsettling journey -- a terribly moving document.	2010-09-24
There are literally dozens of documentaries about the Warsaw Ghetto, but A Film Unfinished is unique in a very horrible way.	2010-09-24
A Film Unfinished may not be the strangest making-of documentary you've ever seen. It may, however, be the most affecting.	2010-09-24
The reconstructed film and Hersonski's filling and framing devices are a worthwhile social artifact and a reminder of the lengths the Nazis went to to deflect the world's attention from their real intent: genocide.	2010-09-23
Hersonski not only dispels the big lie at the center of the Nazi footage but she ingeniously separates and identifies the many smaller lies and where they entwined with facts.	2010-09-23
What we're seeing isn't the aftermath of an extermination plot, as in the post-liberation concentration camp films, but the dehumanization process itself.	2010-09-23
Some realities even the best propagandists can't spin.	2010-09-22
To see the images of the inhabitants of the Warsaw Ghetto, the look of terror in their faces and the bodies of the dead randomly strewn about, is a gut wrenching experience.	2010-09-14
It is a privileged experience to watch A Film Unfinished. There is no other historical document like it but, of course, its lasting value is as a human document.	2010-09-10
The Nazis' infatuation with documentation is visible everywhere in A Film Unfinished, as German soldiers grab residents' arms or push them along in the street, as starving children sit on curbs and adults hurry along sidewalks.	2010-09-05
The imperatives of history are manifold, and this film is among the most urgent of them.	2010-08-26
Hersonski has done Holocaust scholarship a great favor. Just when we thought there were no new twists to the story of the Warsaw Ghetto comes this documentary: focused, sorrowful and revelatory.	2010-08-20
While much of A Film Unfinished is a fairly dry presentation of primarily historical interest, the reminiscences of the survivors give it a deeper human dimension.	2010-08-19
What sets Hersonski's film apart from many other films on the Holocaust is its study of the Nazis themselves	2010-08-19
A Film Unfinished is affecting as a rare document of a terrible place and time, and those who lived there.	2010-08-19
Historical rather than cinematic, 'A Film Unfinished' is not entended to be entertainment.	2010-08-19
There is only about an hour of it, but around it filmmaker Yael Hersonski has built a striking feature.	2010-08-19
Extremely unsettling and thought- provoking.	2010-08-19
Think what Hannah Arendt could have made of this footage? Typical of contemporary advocacy journalism, Hersonski doesn't know what to do with this outrageous material except show it.	2010-08-18
Powerful warning with universal message-movies lie. Without memory and context, we forget the truth and believe what we see. Meticulously detailed, overwhelmingly emotional.	2010-08-18
It will test your faith in humanity, but Hersonski's film is nonetheless a brilliant reminder of the importance of bearing witness.	2010-08-18
Moving, mysterious and intellectually provocative, A Film Unfinished positions familiar Holocaust horrors (the R rating was unsuccessfully contested) within a philosophical commentary on the way we view images.	2010-08-18
For the most part, the jokes are mildly relevant at least	2014-01-06
I know comedy is subjective, so grant me that Vampires Suck just did not make me laugh. It probably doesn't help that, as a spoof on the Twilight franchise, it's making fun of movies I also don't enjoy.	2013-06-03
It's almost as cynical as the actual Twilight, and not nearly as funny.	2013-06-03
All but the most die-hard fans can agree that the Twilight movies are spoof-worthy. So it's too bad they don't get a worthy spoof.	2013-06-03
An insult to other bad vampire movies, which is saying a mouthful.	2013-02-04
There are few things worse than watching a comedy flatline for over an hour, tossing its "funny parts" into a vacuum of uncomfortable silence.	2012-02-09
A banal mess that sacrifices anything resembling satire for a series of smutty jokes.	2011-08-30
Only Friedberg and Seltzer could film this dross with the belief they are making even a half-decent comedy.	2011-02-18
Casting two lookalikes and coaching your young actors to mimic the trio from 'Twilight' isn't enough to make for a great parody.	2010-12-14
There was a time when, for a certain generation, the release of a new Naked Gun or Hot Shots movie would be cause for real excitement.	2010-10-30
A movie that will have you pining to watch the real Twilight films. Yes, it's that bad.	2010-10-19
A witless, puerile spoof of the Twilight movies.	2010-10-18
Vampires Suck misses its targets in spectacular fashion thanks to the directors' usual approach of simply recreating scenes from the original movies without any real understanding of what to satirise or even how to go about it.	2010-10-18
It's not quite as bad as Friedberg and Seltzer's usual output, but only in the way that measles is better than mumps.	2010-10-15
So many accurate puns could be made about the title of this film that it hardly seems worth bothering.	2010-10-15
They don't suck as much as lame-brain parodists Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.	2010-10-15
It's almost fascinatingly awful, nailing the moony tedium of its target franchise with something close to suicidal exactitude.	2010-10-14
The last time I heard a film audience in such a state of silence was during Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light.	2010-10-14
The erratic, barely humorous dialogue here is even more ghastly than your average spoof, while Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's direction is patchy, to say the least.	2010-10-14
It's marginally sharper than the likes of Meet The Spartans -- yes, that good -- but essentially as tatty as a porn parody, without all the best bits.	2010-10-14
Every time we see a new Friedberg/Seltzer film we hope maybe they've learned something and put their skills to more creative use. But no, instead we're once again astounded that anyone gives them money to make these unfunny rehashes.	2010-10-14
A Twilight pastiche with all the wit you'd expect from the makers of Scary Movie and Meet The Spartans.	2010-10-13
A few broader references might have made this punishing one-note trawl through the eminently spoofable tween-vamp saga slightly more watchable.	2010-10-13
The Twilight Saga is an obvious target for parody, but this crude and unfunny movie makes a hash of it.	2010-10-13
It seems to have brought out the best (well, better) in serial spoof merchants Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who have never been so focussed in their mickey-taking mash-ups.	2010-10-13
The specific target of the Twilight movies gives Vampires Suck a little more structure than these films normally have, but this is still a painfully unfunny comedy...	2010-10-13
Talent borrows, genius steals. Rank idiocy, on the other hand, spoofs.	2010-10-10
Friedberg and Seltzer tap into the inherent humorlessness of the "Twilight" films and their most rabid fans ? because it?s always good to laugh at those who can?t laugh at themselves.	2010-10-08
Tosses off some blunt-force one-liners, coasts on character impersonation, riffs off the originals' plot points, and pretends its cheap imitation of the Saga's mopey, slow scenes are parody. In other words, Vampires Suck bites.	2010-09-08
Obviously, Vampires Suck is not a good film, but that it's not a complete and total abomination makes the attempt feel like something close to progress for its creators.	2010-09-02
THE most surprising thing about Vampires Suck is that some parts of it almost work. Almost.	2010-09-02
A characteristic work of monumentally lazy spoof comedy by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, Vampires Suck confirms Idiocracy's prediction of modern man's devolution from humdrum mediocrity to sub-caveman levels of intelligence.	2010-08-30
You want vampiric satire with actual laughs? Try Mel Brooks' Dracula: Dead and Loving It, Love at First Bite, or even Roman Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers. Anything is better than Friedberg and Seltzer's un-comedy.	2010-08-28
They certainly do here.	2010-08-27
Vampires Suck has its heart in the right place, but it could've done with sharper fangs.	2010-08-27
The latest nitwit spoof from the opportunistic Friedberg-and-Seltzer team is a cut above its scattershot predecessors, due to the specificity of its target and to Jenn Proske's spot-on impersonation of twitchy, angsty Kristen Stewart.	2010-08-27
Boy, talk about truth in advertising.	2010-08-26
The greatest achievement of Vampires Suck is an entirely unintentional one -- in condensing the key story elements of the three Twilight films into less than 90 minutes, it pinpoints what bloated melodramas Meyers' films really are.	2010-08-26
However, there is a shining light. And that is first-timer Proske. She's obviously done her homework because her twitching, moping performance of Kristen Stewart's Bella is spot on. In fact, it's so good that it becomes annoying.	2010-08-26
A parody of the Twilight movies so painfully unfunny it could turn proud Twilight haters into lifelong fans.	2010-08-26
Given the coy handling of sex and violence that was portrayed in the original Twilight movies, it's a mild thrill to see their titillating subtext so brutally spelt out.	2010-08-26
This movie sucks more.	2010-08-26
Will it top Rotten Tomatoes' worst of the worst at year's end? If anyone still remembers it by then, it'll be the leading candidate.	2010-08-26
Rated PG-13 for, among other things, crude sexual content... I disagree in the strongest terms with the implication that this film has anything resembling content.	2010-08-25
If I ever feel the unlikely urge to see Friedberg and Seltzer's work again, I'll be going back to YouTube. As this latest effort confirms, their small bites are definitely the best.	2010-08-25
With luck, practice and divine intervention, these boys might aspire to mediocrity borne on a cloud of the sophomoric.	2010-08-25
Truth in advertising 'Vampires suck' and so does this movie	2010-08-24
Below bottom-of-the-barrel.	2010-08-23
fails to find anything remotely winning with its hunt and peck sense of humor	2010-08-23
Imagine a clever cartoonist turning his pen from the politicians to these [Twilight] characters and you'll get some idea of the fun that can be had	2010-08-22
[Shyamalan] works so much better with stories that are slower in development, where the atmosphere and tone drive the film, and where you're never quite sure what's going on (though not in the sense where you're completely confused, like this film).	2012-09-25
This is a kid's movie that doesn't seem to realize that it's a kid's movie.	2011-04-04
Bad acting, overstuffed exposition and running time far too brief for the amount of plot shoved into it reduce The Last Airbender into parody of a big summer film as Shyamalan manages to hit every single fantasy film pothole.	2011-03-29
The Last Airbender is swollen with portentous mumbo jumbo and realized in the most simplistic and mundane ways imaginable.	2011-03-09
The Last Airbender is a horrific mish-mash of genres that follows a depressingly large number of dead ends in adapting its source material.	2011-02-01
Kiddie-strength action scenes drag the film down, but the kiss of death is Shyamalan's gratuitous use of earth tones and the general dull, drab look of the film. ... drastically reduces the intensity of the 3-D effects	2011-01-31
An amateurish mess.	2011-01-18
Is it a masterpiece? Oh god no, but... I'm intrigued to see where the next film goes...	2011-01-04
The constant references to 'benders' can't help but elicit sniggers from British audiences ... the plotting is stodgy, the dialogue stinks and the acting is wooden.	2011-01-04
As far as children's entertainment goes (and it is children's entertainment), it could be a lot worse.	2010-12-07
The film is an unmitigated disaster, a putrid patchwork of the original series stitched together by wretched performances, bad creative decisions and a story that's all exposition, no depth.	2010-12-04
Mere words can barely describe the sheer inanity on display.	2010-11-26
It's a nice movie to look at, as long as you ignore the characters, plot, and action.	2010-11-18
It seems as if a good film could be made out of The Last Airbender's tale. But this is not that film.	2010-10-21
The characters are completely uninvolving, the narrative incomprehensible for the most part, and the performances seem to reflect the bewilderment of the plot.	2010-09-23
Why do the water tribe have so much difficulty defeating their fire opponents when the battle takes place on the ocean?	2010-09-22
Unspeakably bad dialogue delivered by excruciatingly bad actors in a plot so illogical and stupid it kills unicorns.	2010-09-21
Shyamalan tells the story like a syndicated news journalist, reporting events with detached direction and lifeless, plot-driven screenwriting.	2010-09-21
The worst part is undoubtedly the script, which clunks and groans all the way under the weight of it's own exposition - tragically and unforgivably, it fails to tell a good story.	2010-09-19
The mythology of the series doesn't translate well to the demands of concise big screen storytelling.	2010-09-17
It is in writer/director Shyamalan's dialogue that the film grinds to a halt. His words have grown increasingly pompous and stilted since his concise, crisp, Oscar-nominated script for The Sixth Sense.	2010-09-16
This empty, misfired epic from M. Night Shyamalan is boring and strengthens the claim that he is the worst director working in mainstream cinema today.	2010-09-16
If sleep is a hard thing to come by, then a dose of M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender is just the cure for you.	2010-09-16
Being a Shyamalan film, the entire cast (which also includes Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel as an exiled Fire Prince) recite their looney-tunes lines as if they have been drugged, then hypnotised, then drugged again.	2010-09-15
A big ol' mess of atrocious acting and terrible scripting, The Last Airbender is a definite nominee for worst film of 2010.	2010-09-15
With poorly executed action, wooden acting and a dead script, this fantasy film is a strong contender for a Razzie.	2010-09-13
Parents may be less easily pleased, finding the film a tad dull and lifeless, for all its elements.	2010-09-12
Shyamalan has written a muddled, confusing script and directed it badly	2010-09-12
$150,000,000 well wasted. The Last Airbender is an insult to those wanting sophisticated, entertaining or even competent cinema.	2010-08-26
Even pre-teens will have to endure the fragmented plot lines, stilted acting, and an absence of humor.	2010-08-22
How did Shyamalan get it so wrong?	2010-08-19
Some of the worst acting, action and dialogue you'll endure this year.	2010-08-19
The dialogue is tin-eared in the extreme, the 3D is used in a strictly tokenistic fashion and the absolute lack of a sense of irony or humour makes the more solemn scenes all the more laughable.	2010-08-19
After the first five seconds, it seems as if you have been watching it for around two-and-a-half hours, and that this time has passed in four-and-a-half days.	2010-08-13
Please let it be the last Shyamalan.	2010-08-13
[A] slice of self-important nonsense that's actually pretty funny, although probably not in the way Shyamalan planned.	2010-08-13
Airbender's final insult is the unmistakable stench of a sequel that's left to linger in its wake.	2010-08-13
Some of the performances are wooden, creating repeated moments of unintentional hilarity that cut through the dramatic tension.	2010-08-13
The first part of a planned trilogy, Shyamalan says the sequel will be darker. Just better would be a start.	2010-08-13
Far from the catastrophe the US bewailed, but still disappointingly clunky.	2010-08-12
One is bored and stupefied by what seems like an eternity of vacuous spectacle, cod-Buddhist tosh and clunking dialogue.	2010-08-12
I swiftly became bored with a repetitive and laboured film devoid of drama, tension or real emotion.	2010-08-12
When nothing you believe or believe in is at stake, your plot-receptor mechanisms close down.	2010-08-12
Dung fu.	2010-08-12
A movie that's as thick as the earth, as enraging as fire, and about as watery and windy as a giant cinematic wet fart.	2010-08-12
A dodgy script, ropey performances, atrocious 3D effects and a tendency to take itself too seriously...	2010-08-11
A derivative and lifeless 'heroes journey' tale layered up with Eastern mysticism.	2010-08-03
...a tremendously disappointing effort from a once rock-solid filmmaker.	2010-08-03
The Last Airbender completes writer/co-producer/director M. Night Shyamalan's fall from grace; once regarded as the most exciting talent in film, he now sits pretty as the laughing stock of Hollywood.	2010-07-16
Shyamalan has been working in cinema for more than a decade now, but none of his films are nearly as disastrous as this. It's his final plea to get his name back in Hollywood, and I don't think anyone will hear it.	2010-07-15
That even the kids in the audience didn't really laugh at all the hyperactive mugging and slapsticky animal nonsense pretty much tells you what an excruciating 91-minute endurance test this is.	2012-04-08
Here is a film that doesn't just scrape the bottom of the barrel, it demands that you lick it.	2010-09-23
Almost as much of a relief as making it through to the end is realising earlier on that none of the creatures will be talking for the duration of the picture. This reduces the annoyance factor considerably for anyone over the age of nine.	2010-09-22
Filled with pratfalls, slapstick and toilet humour, this furry nonsense with an eco-friendly message is harmless family fun.	2010-09-12
If there's an award for taking a great idea and strangling it to death with mediocre execution, this should get it.	2010-09-03
Is there really such a paucity of live-action family films on offer that Furry Vengeance needs a release at all?	2010-09-01
Oh, the horror! It's the writers who deserve to be sprayed by skunks for giving us this stinker.	2010-08-19
Oh, the horror! It's the writers who deserve to be sprayed by skunks for giving us this stinker.	2010-08-19
Fraser's career may be dying hard with this vengeance...	2010-06-28
Fraser merece creditos pelo esforco e por nao temer o ridiculo. Por outro lado, isto nao e desculpa para a atrocidade representada por este filme racista, mal dirigido e sem a menor graca.	2010-05-29
People often ask reviewers to choose the worst film of the year so far. At last I have a cast-iron candidate.	2010-05-13
Furry a bit mangy.	2010-05-12
A feeble family comedy that really tests your patience.	2010-05-10
Even by the low standards of live action funny animal movies, Furry Vengeance is a pretty bad film, the sort of low gag rate family flick that aims for generic suitable-for-all fun and satisfies no-one in the process.	2010-05-10
Seemingly written to the tastes of underachieving five-year-olds, director Roger Kumble ("Cruel Intentions") is hamstrung to create an even mildly entertaining children's comedy.	2010-05-08
There is an environmental message delivered along with the goofy mayhem involved in catching the fuzzy culprits. But fair warning: once inside the theater, the audience is trapped.	2010-05-07
One of those sad little movies upstaged by its own vastly superior trailer.	2010-05-07
Shields is not a natural comic performer, to say the least. Her face has the comic mobility and expressiveness of an Easter Island statue.	2010-05-07
The film is hectoring enough to put the green movement back 100 years, and you end up wondering how many trees have been felled and air-miles flown to make this abject excuse for slapstick comedy.	2010-05-06
The best thing you can say about Furry Vengeance is that it's kid friendly -- provided, that is, the kids are under five and a touch slow.	2010-05-06
Sophisticated it isn't, but there are some decent visual gags and Fraser is good fun as the man at war with nature.	2010-05-06
Fraser's lantern-jawed mugging becomes irritating all too soon, although younger viewers may get a kick out of the ingenious antics of skunks, raccoons and grizzly bears as they get the better of numbskull humans.	2010-05-06
Not a good time. Seriously, really not a good time.	2010-05-06
Goofball fun that will have kids -- big and small -- rolling in the aisles	2010-05-06
Not a film where viewers will learn an awful lot, this is aimed fair and square at entertaining children and perhaps their parents' inner children. In this aim, it succeeds.	2010-05-06
Did they have to pad it out with so many repeated pratfalls and inconsequential guff? It should play well enough with the under tens, mind.	2010-05-06
If you only take your children to see movies like Up ... they'll think every film is going to be fantastic. That's not very good training for the disappointments of life, so Furry Vengeance does have one purpose.	2010-05-06
Overall, it's all a bit rubbish, but if you like Brendan Fraser's big rubbery face then there's chuckles to be had.	2010-05-06
The animals steal Brendan's clothes, wee and guff in his face and roll him downhill in a locked Portaloo. And it's all pretty funny.	2010-05-06
When you throw furry animals, silly slapstick and rubber-faced big-name stars at the screen, and you can still hear more children crying than laughing in the audience, you can't help but feel that they've missed the point somewhat.	2010-05-06
an experience in collective embarrassment %u2014 embarrassment for yourself, your fellow audience and the actors onscreen forced to take part in the movie's wildly inept, bottom-of-the-barrel shenanigans.	2010-05-05
Mind-rottingly reprehensible and vile -- not to mention stupefyingly unfunny and embarrassing.	2010-05-05
Disappointing comedy that's let down by a lazy script, some truly dreadful CGI effects and a lack of decent laughs, though undemanding young children will probably enjoy it.	2010-05-05
This is not a film you will enjoy. I promise. Of course, there's always the chance that there's someone out there will like it, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. The odds are pretty great in my favor.	2010-05-04
It's Mother Nature against the Pillsbury Dough Boy!	2010-05-04
The movie is both slack and dumb -- a trying combo -- and it's heavily burdened with a big green message.	2010-05-03
Furry Vengeance is heavy on eco-moralizing and poop jokes but a little short on likable two-legged characters.	2010-05-02
Kids will probably enjoy the scenes with the animals getting the best of the humans, and they will all absorb the message that nature needs to be protected, All the bad acting and boring moments in the script will be overlooked.	2010-05-02
There is nothing remotely entertaining, endearing or enjoyable about 'Furry Vengeance,' a ghastly movie that has to be one of the year's worst.	2010-05-02
So few films are totally aimed at kids, and tearing this one to shreds is not pleasurable.	2010-05-02
It is not, repeat NOT, for anyone whose age is approaching double-digits	2010-05-01
It's hard to watch Brendan Fraser do the slapstick required for a role better suited to someone like Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell.	2010-05-01
Brendan Fraser should know better. Then again, his career choices continue to insist that he doesn't.	2010-04-30
The end credits cast sing-along to a cover of 'Insane in the Brain' completes the litany of idiotic filmmaking choices that made the whole thing so unwatchable to begin with.	2010-04-30
Witless and wince-inducing -- a slapstick misfire of epic proportions, even by downwardly adjusted expectations of movies in which anthropomorphized animals do battle with humans.	2010-04-30
Brendan Fraser: Human being or cartoon character?	2010-04-30
Furry Vengeance is a collection of feeble jokes in the service of green themes. Sustainability never looked so stupid.	2010-04-30
Furry Vengeance is billed as a comedy, but I doubt it'll make you laugh. It might, however, cause you to weep for Brendan Fraser.	2010-04-30
The paradox here is that the message of respect for animal life is outweighed by the lack of respect for human beings.	2010-04-30
Furry Vengeance is unbearable. (Actually, the bear's performance is pretty good.)	2010-04-30
a gross mis-use of CGI animals	2014-01-19
full review at Movies for the Masses	2010-09-11
Marmaduke sinks to Beverly Hills Chihuahua levels of awfulness and only reaffirms that talking animals aren't funny -- they're boring.	2010-09-07
Spectacularly sentimental, full of ridiculous computer-animated action, and makes sure its animals are a good deal less pallid than the humans on view.	2010-08-26
There is only so much fun you can have with a talking dog and Marmaduke quickly exhausts the possibilities.	2010-08-23
Better than Cats & Dogs, but praise hardly comes much lower.	2010-08-21
Fans of the single-panel cartoon that has run in newspapers since the 1950s will find plenty to disappoint them in this live-action adaptation.	2010-08-20
The incoherent, moralising script demeans a number of actors, including William H. Macy, Judy Greer and David Walliams, reduced by a kindly editor to an ineffective cameo.	2010-08-20
Dogs may be for life but the memory of this film will last about 20 seconds.	2010-08-20
Oh dear.	2010-08-20
Mirthless family romp that hits all the lowest comedy dominators.	2010-08-19
Once upon a time, there was a promising young acting talent who went by the name of Owen Wilson.	2010-08-19
Generally has its heart in the right place, there's some good slapstick and you have to admire the patience of filmmakers who are prepared to work with this many animals on one set.	2010-08-19
Although comfortably under 90 minutes, Marmaduke is an epic chore to sit through.	2010-08-19
With his eyes goggling and his gob smudging all over the place, he looks like a haunted painting.	2010-08-19
Never veers from The Hollywood Guide To Mid-Budget Family Fare.	2010-08-19
While not quite as bad as it could have been, this is very much Hollywood-schmaltz-by-numbers.	2010-08-19
You could do worse with young kids, and they'll romp along with Marmaduke's throwaway adventures, it's just there's much better stuff out there that will entertain viewers above the age of 10 too.	2010-08-18
It's as if Pixar never happened.	2010-08-16
The novelty quickly fades since -- you guessed it -- the story's just not there.	2010-08-13
It's dull and conventional, turning a half-century of mischief into 80 minutes of yawns.	2010-07-06
[It] sounds like the makings of a totally rad John Hughes movie. Instead, it's an intermittently amusing parable about an outcast's ascension, as performed by a pack of digitally manipulated dogs. Next.	2010-07-06
Marmaduke was never meant to star in his own movie; trying to strap a story to his back ends up a clunky and often lame affair.	2010-07-06
'The conventionality and predictability of every scene, the lame puns, the absence of comic rhythm, the fart jokes butt-ending the film--all was sly metafilmic parody of the sheer banality and crassness of so much present-day film comedy, yes?' (Silence.)	2010-07-05
The movie works in a way that toddlers and early primary schoolers will definitely dig.	2010-07-01
...a bottom-of-the-barrel family film...	2010-06-25
It's not like the movie's target audience has fond memories of a newspaper comic strip. They probably don't even know that newspapers were things people used to read.	2010-06-22
Previously, director Tom Dey made "Failure to Launch" and "Showtime," the latter of which was one of the worst movies of 2002. Congratulations Tom, you've done it again in 2010 with "Marmaduke."	2010-06-20
Crammed with more recycled offal than a can of Alpo, Marmaduke exults in fart jokes, offensive stereotypes (the cat, voiced by George Lopez, laps guacamole), and sloppy storytelling. Bad, bad dog.	2010-06-10
Well, here's another talking-animal movie, full of computer-generated imagery and body-function humor.	2010-06-09
It's a talking-animal movie based on a one-joke, not-very-funny comic strip. That should be sufficient information for anyone old enough to read this review.	2010-06-09
Truly a milquetoast Scooby Snack for pet-friendly families who thrill to computer-generated mouth movements on real-life four-legged critters.	2010-06-09
What's next: a Family Circus movie? Where o where is the hero who will save us?	2010-06-08
Insipid and lumbering - with a title character perpetually emitting noxious gas fumes.	2010-06-08
Will entertain the kids but it should have been a Disney Channel movie	2010-06-08
I had a Scooby-Doo nightmare flashback.	2010-06-07
This movie is one big dog.	2010-06-07
Biting the neighbors' tires for 90 minutes seems like a far better use of time. Like an overpopulated puppy park on a Fourth of July weekend, this shaggy dog story stinks to high heaven.	2010-06-07
A low-impact kid's comedy, "Marmaduke" may have little in common with the comic strip upon which it's based but remains a perfectly viable flick for dog-loving families.	2010-06-07
This threadbare film mostly feels like a way to keep out-of-school kids occupied during summertime.	2010-06-06
Instead of spending $20 or more on tickets to Marmaduke, read the original strip for free at http://comics.com/marmaduke. In addition to the more agreeable price, it also has more laughs.	2010-06-05
Insulting and vile... Marmaduke presumes that [children] are the most loathsome, stupid beings in the world.	2010-06-04
The only revelation in this movie is that stilted dialogue doesn't sound any better coming out of a computer-animated dog's mouth than a human's.	2010-06-04
Scripters Tim Rasmussen and Vince Di Meglio have cobbled together a plot from bits and pieces of other family-friendly pics.	2010-06-04
This tale of a philosophical Great Dane who speaks with Owen Wilson's voice is not entirely without merit. Well, actually, it is, but never mind.	2010-06-04
In a genre so choked with cynical films, this one was made with enough skill and heart to make its emotional payoffs believable and welcome.	2010-06-04
Brad Anderson's long-running saga of the melty-looking Winslow family and the gangling, interfering Great Dane that should've been put to sleep ages ago gets a film treatment.	2010-06-04
This is another opus to take that small, well-trodden step from the funny pages to the big screen. But we're in live-action territory here, meaning that real people actors compete for camera time with real dog actors.	2010-06-04
Bland sitcom romp based on the long-running comic strip features wisecracking canines in a beach-set family story.	2010-06-04
The dogs are cute -- I'll say that for it.	2010-06-04
The film doesn't take the direction most sequels do and manages to adequately follow up the original.	2009-10-31
In every way superior to its predecessor in terms of performances, story, characterization, gore, and climax.	2009-04-29
like the story, hate the directing	2008-07-05
A Reloaded style one-up in which more people are trapped in bigger places and forced to perform scarier tasks with nastier results. Wow.	2008-01-17
Quite hideous.	2007-09-27
The ornate sadism isn't enough to carry our interest this time around.	2007-08-18
By no means a masterpiece of the genre, but it's a slickly made picture that more than delivers on the promise made on its poster--oh yes, there will be blood.	2007-03-01
Ultimately uninteresting.	2006-02-12
The slaughter in Saw II is pretty much non-stop, but you always see it coming. The movie's not really that scary, just gross in what by now is a fairly routine way.	2006-02-07
It's an unpleasant film with grotesque imagery, but Nine Inch Nails' "Closer" video is more unsettling than this mostly predictable bloodbath.	2005-12-12
Saw 2 gives talented, creepy-looking character actor Tobin Bell the chance to shine again as the cancer-ridden serial killer.	2005-12-10
A grimy and relentless portrayal of high-tension cruelty that's excruciating to watch but as riveting as a nail gun to the nut sack.	2005-12-10
Saw II feels like an episode of Fear Factor or Big Brother with Rob Zombie at the helm, and if that doesn't scare you away from this ridiculous movie, well, feel free to indulge your questionable tastes.	2005-12-10
Saw II is a nasty piece of work ...	2005-12-10
... a sequel that shows some of the same boldness and intellect of the first one.	2005-12-10
This macabre follow-up to 2004's low-budget horror smash can't rival its predecessor's fiendish ingenuity. But it makes up for it with a deliciously devious plot and enough gory shocks for a dozen Halloweens.	2005-12-10
In a fun house like this the elaborate tortures seem to leave behind the real world of pain and suffering for the realm of slapstick; they're the kind of horrors that make you scream and laugh at the same time.	2005-12-10
To enjoy Saw II, one must have enjoyed Saw. This is a given. As to which is better, this is a fairly pointless question given how bad both of these movies are.	2005-12-10
[Jigsaw] is like John Keating from Dead Poet's Society, if Keating used hypodermic needles and hacksaws instead of Walt Whitman.	2005-12-10
Ainda que relativamente engenhoso, o roteiro depende excessivamente de coincidencias e revela-se pouco original, alem de nao conseguir criar um unico personagem com quem o publico possa se identificar.	2005-12-04
Bousman a su trafiquer la facture originale pour en accentuer l'impact et la rendre, aussi etrange que cela puisse paraitre, un peu plus credible.	2005-11-25
It's not slick, it's not empowering, and it's not pretty. But what it does -- efficiently exploiting our primal fears -- it does pretty well.	2005-11-21
Saw II is pure schlock, which was clearly the intention: grimy grainy photography, flashbacks that strike like lightning bolts, plot holes galore and no jokes to speak of.	2005-11-11
Veni vidi vomit. That's Latin for: I came, I saw, I saw 'Saw II.'	2005-11-07
The raucous results: Saw II is a shameless spectacle of squirming and squealing without maintaining much solid suspense in its warped, blood-clotting heart	2005-11-07
Jigsaw returns, this time as self-styled family counselor.	2005-11-05
An utterly sadistic horror picture that exists for no other reason and has no discernible point apart from getting horror fans to shell out a few bucks.	2005-11-02
If you saw the first "Saw," you'll want to see "Saw II," too.	2005-11-02
It was like finding the peanut butter cup in a sea of Mounds bars.	2005-10-31
One of those rare sequels that surpass the foundation it was built on.	2005-10-31
...is supposed to jar you, but here's the funny thing about 90 minutes of bludgeoning and bloodletting: It usually just leaves me numb.	2005-10-30
[T]he earnest message-ification... vies with the meaningless and sadistic violence as the most stomach-turning aspect of the flick.	2005-10-30
... the bad news is that there's less (Jigsaw) innovation... the good news is there's no crying Cary Elwes.	2005-10-30
needlessly revolting	2005-10-29
An ugly, joyless horror movie that deserves to be tossed into the business end of 1988's "Woodchipper Massacre."	2005-10-29
The rare sequel that improves upon its predecessor, Saw II is an exploitation flick with style and skill to go along with its stream of red stuff.	2005-10-29
Saw II is bound to give fans of the original a real buzz.	2005-10-28
In 'Saw II,' both the cops and the victims are so dim the whole elaborate exercise hardly seems worthwhile.	2005-10-28
Unable to deliver the single novel concept or unexpected surprise that might justify its existence.	2005-10-28
By referencing horror masters Dario Argento and Wes Craven, the film invites comparison to much better movies, [with] none of Argento's style or Craven's savagely sardonic of sense of humor.	2005-10-28
Quite possibly Saw II sheds enough blood to satisfy horror aficionados.	2005-10-28
The problem with the big game is that it doesn't have that same fear factor - a deadly gas? (You can't see any impending doom, except for a couple of phlegmy coughs).	2005-10-28
The second Saw isn't as accomplished or precise as the first, but it's well worth watching because, in an era when most movies are forgotten before the popcorn is digested, it makes you feel something.	2005-10-28
As it was in the first Saw, audiences are faced with insane leaps in logic that sabotage the last part of the film.	2005-10-28
The film's one-note dialogue, insufferable characters and lack of scares make Saw II just a tedious exercise in explicit violence.	2005-10-28
Saw II only has one ambition -- to make us squirm. And it does. Just don't be surprised if you need to switch to an electric razor after this.	2005-10-28
Not a total waste of your serial-killer dollar.	2005-10-28
Saw II -- better-acted than its predecessor, which isn't saying much -- is so gratuitously, sadistically violent, and to such little end, that it finally falls over dead on the far side of obscene.	2005-10-28
Promising unnerving thrills, Saw II delivers.	2005-10-28
Saw II has teeth, and this house-of-horrors franchise has legs, though they're manacled to the radiator.	2005-10-28
What [Wes Craven] wound up with was a witless stab-the-teen time-waster that could be his worst film ever. And considering 2005's wretched Cursed, that's pretty bad.	2013-02-15
Places too much time in the hands of disposable characters - so that it is neither a brainless slasher flick nor an immersive character piece based in a serial massacre.	2012-10-05
"My Soul to Take" is one of the most banal horror films I've seen in the past few years, which makes it surprising that it comes from the mind of horror master Wes Craven, who gave birth to the legendary horror icon Freddy Krueger.	2012-09-22
A single-serving package of adrenaline that wears off quickly.	2011-08-15
The filmmaker's red herrings prove depressingly incapable of hiding the real fiend's identity.	2011-04-21
Everyone in front of and behind the camera look and feel like they're lifting the heaviest, least horrifying ton of bricks invented.	2011-04-04
Is it just possible that Craven fumbled the ball this time and gave us the equivalent of a fairly amateur teen horror flick?	2011-03-21
full review at Movies for the Masses	2011-03-01
Clunky bird metaphors, blind kids grabbing for dangling ropes, a Horshack-ian best friend with an abusive stepfather, and a story that would be impossible if any of these kids drove a car, sum up most of the more obvious problems with the film.	2011-02-25
Confused, poorly executed, sporadic and incredibly messy, but despite its pitfalls, My Soul to Take is an enormously entertaining bad movie.	2011-02-10
There's some malarkey about each kid having inherited one of the maniac's personalities, though Craven never does much with that except to point the finger of suspicion at junior.	2011-01-05
...the film not only marks a low point within Craven's career but also within the horror genre itself.	2010-11-10
It's talky, schlocky and stalk-y.	2010-10-30
With either too much or too little happening on screen and a script juggling too many red herrings at once, My Soul to Take feels like Purgatory... in 3D.	2010-10-27
The best thing about My Soul to Take is that it may force folks to revisit Wes Craven's past works and finally realize that he's always been nothing more than a hack in the horror field, a Uwe Boll with a better sense of where to place the camera.	2010-10-22
While there's much to like about the ideas and atmosphere, Craven can't muster much out of his characters or script to form an interesting message.	2010-10-18
My Soul to Take ends up being mere Chucky cheese.	2010-10-18
Craven's writing starts out over the top and just keeps climbing ...	2010-10-16
disappointing in the way it drags out its narrative to little effect, substituting cheap revelations and sometimes incoherent action for anything resembling the kind of innovation and verve that is the hallmark of Craven's best work	2010-10-15
This utterly mediocre forget-me-now could've been crafted by any faceless serial director at all.	2010-10-15
A typically ruthless and cynically comic horror thriller from Craven, set in a high school where the caste system is more terrifying than the possibility of a murderous ghost (the bullying leader of the mean girls is nicknamed 'Fang').	2010-10-15
A thrill-free snooze that will certainly rank as one of the least -- if not the least -- effective entries in Craven's nearly 40-year canon of cinematic shockers.	2010-10-15
Hands down the worst horror movie of the year, and certainly the worst of Wes Craven's career.	2010-10-13
Why am I kinda sorta not really recommending, but mildly defending this movie? Well, as noted, I had fun with it. I was entertained.	2010-10-13
That Craven is earnestly trying to make an on-the-level, snark-free horror flick signals a welcome sea change in his career.	2010-10-13
There are plenty of formulaic boo! moments, yet Craven intelligently treats Bug's otherworldly issues like hormonal growing pains that must be tamed.	2010-10-13
This film quickly moves to the top of the list of 'Most Purposeless Use of 3D' beating out 'The Last Airbender' and 'Clash of the Titans' with ease.	2010-10-12
Wes Craven has seen better days and we all have seen better movies; the 3-D didn't add a thing	2010-10-12
My Soul to Take lacks quality 3D and the one, standout, never-seen-before scare necessary to get horror fans spreading the word to fellow scary movie buffs.	2010-10-12
as much a soul-sucking experience as what the characters themselves are experiencing	2010-10-11
But then maybe it's asking too much to have characters and a story as one dimensional as this to ever appear to have three dimensions. So in this case, the 3D's of Craven's film are: Dumb, Dull, and Deceptive.	2010-10-11
Might not be Wes Craven's best film, but it's certainly his worst.	2010-10-11
What sinks it is Craven's simplistic, ham-fisted writing and inert direction.	2010-10-11
The worst horror movie Wes Craven's made perhaps ever.	2010-10-10
Yep, this movie is garbage.	2010-10-10
"My Soul to Take" is one of the worst films I?ve seen this year and easily the most irritating.	2010-10-09
The silly story can be forgiven. Almost no other living director can instill such a sense of gleeful dread in the autumn woods ... or in an ordinary house.	2010-10-09
Only someone so smart could make a movie this stupid.	2010-10-09
A puzzle with no solutions, a tale with a twist that isn't a twist at all.	2010-10-09
Downright hilarious in places ? though I don?t think that?s intentional, because it?s also dull and cliche-ridden.	2010-10-08
It's good, theoretically at least, to have Craven back. But why come back for this?	2010-10-08
A thoroughly dreary, by-the-numbers exercise.	2010-10-08
All might be good for a flask-to-the-theater laugh, if not for the unconscionable price gouging.	2010-10-08
Wes Craven's first new movie in five years is a brainless, joyless, and yes, you might even say, soulless teen slasher.	2010-10-08
It's your money that's at greater stake with this subpar horror entry in barely noticeable 3D.	2010-10-08
This dumb, derivative teen slasher movie would be uninspiring coming from any writer-director, let alone one with several genre classics under his belt.	2010-10-08
the most awful kind of entertainment exploitation in that everything is set up to abuse the audience, not the characters	2010-10-08
The picture is directed with such a loose, slack hand that you'd think Craven had never directed a slasher-thriller before: I didn't jump once; I never even felt vaguely scared or creeped out.	2010-10-08
It's too mild-mannered for those who relish horror pictures and too gory and plotless and chatty for everyone else.	2010-10-08
Just another Wes Craven kills kids running around in the woods movie.	2010-10-08
Families will flock to the holiday release with gusto, but it's up for debate whether 100 minutes with the Focker and Byrnes families is worse than quality time with your own dysfunctional clan.	2013-08-15
The whole enterprise is tired and exhausted and indifferent; even the title is irrelevant and dissembling.	2013-06-22
"Little Fockers" is merely a forgettable romp with these worn out characters.	2012-09-22
Not up to the high standards set by the first two films, but without a doubt a funny and diverting holiday comedy.	2011-09-01
When you're easily outshined by any given episode of Rules of Engagement or Two and a Half Men that means there's a problem.	2011-04-04
Utterly formulaic but not unfunny, despite an overreliance on the comedy of below-the-belt pain (prostates and erections are particularly abused).	2011-03-25
full review at Movies for the Masses	2011-03-01
That talents like De Niro and Stiller would sign off on such a turgid and bone idle attempt to part families with their Christmas cash is stultifying.	2011-02-10
Low-brow humor and forced sight gags rule the day.	2011-02-06
There's nothing like starting out an alleged comedy romp with a disgusting joke about a man's posterior, vomit and sex talk.	2011-01-20
...as dire a comedy as you're likely to see all decade.	2011-01-11
A mapped minefield of bad jokes.	2011-01-07
With the gags cranked up on the humiliation-o-meter, and otherwise stripped of wit, the film offers little in the way of humor to anyone other than sadists.	2011-01-06
Features the same comedy of embarrassment and vulgarity as its predecessors, but also takes a strange sideways step into machismo that leaves it feeling rather joyless	2011-01-04
Perhaps the most dubious comedy franchise in movie history, "Little Fockers" takes another hobbling step toward cinema infamy.	2011-01-03
Oh Mr. De Niro...it hurts to see you like this.	2011-01-01
Third time out for the Meet the Parents franchise, and it's all but impossible to suppress a groan.	2010-12-31
Schindler's List was funnier than this.	2010-12-30
There are less laughs in this tired threquel, which continues to revel in its not-quite-a-swear surname and the ups and downs of family life, this time with an added emphasis on kids and mortality.	2010-12-30
Perhaps they figured as it was six years since the last one, we all might have forgotten the same old jokes from before.	2010-12-29
Per Fockers' actress Blythe Danner: 'All the films have been a joy. I hope they keep coming, even if we graduate to walkers and wheelchairs ...' Oh God. We're all severely focked.	2010-12-29
Ultra-short web clips could probably house the best parts of this sequel, which throughout its 97 minute running time has zilch in the way of comedic cohesion or character moments that ring true.	2010-12-29
The third installment in the series has the stale, slightly sour ambiance you'd expect when walking into a summer house that's been shut up for the winter.	2010-12-28
Too disjointed, too patched together, too many added stars - this series is quickly running out of steam	2010-12-28
What terrible thing have moviegoers done to deserve yet a third outing in this series of alleged comedies?	2010-12-27
Those Fockers. Did you see what I did right there? Made you think of a dirty word didn't I? That's the only 'joke' this third installment offers and they use it over and over again.	2010-12-27
Consistently chuckle-worthy, Little Fockers...somehow sidesteps the law of diminishing returns that usually applies to comedy threequels.	2010-12-27
Lewd, vulgar and tiresome...to quote from Twitter: 'I bet the Robert DeNiro of 'Taxi Driver' would shoot the Robert DeNiro of 'Little Fockers.'	2010-12-27
A lackluster effort and a preposterous plot which add up to a flagging franchise that just 'jumped the shark.'	2010-12-27
This deeply dislikable movie gives vulgarity a bad name.	2010-12-27
Bereft of any ideas at this point, these are some pretty unfunny Fockers.	2010-12-27
This third instalment in the still-not- funny Meet the Parents franchise doesn't even make a pretence of coming up with a decent justification for a new film.	2010-12-27
I'm guessing there will be a fourth and a fifth "Meet the Parents" sequel: "Stepfockers," and "Tween Fockers" or maybe even "As Long as She's Your Second Cousin, You Can Still Focker." Who knows, or cares.	2010-12-26
Hoffman actually does phone in his performance in what is a money grab for everyone, new director Paul Weitz included.	2010-12-25
A film which, in addition to unnecessarily prolonging the Focker franchise, accomplishes the seemingly impossible feat of making Jessica Alba seem rather unsexy.	2010-12-25
Enough is enough. This franchise has run its course and made its millions, but now it's time for it to fock off.	2010-12-24
Its leads' enthusiasm notwithstanding, Little Fockers is a barely tolerable sitcom concoction.	2010-12-24
It's a patchy, unambitious comedy with five or six laughs, and will be passably amusing when it comes on television.	2010-12-24
Little Fockers is a film light on plot, bereft of laughs and featuring a cast who look as if they want to kill themselves.	2010-12-24
Always a sucker for pratfalls, I laughed at quite a few of the gags.	2010-12-24
Any sense of joy, which coursed through Meet The Parents and Meet The Fockers, has completely evaporated.	2010-12-24
A predictable but not unwelcome addition to the Focker family.	2010-12-24
doesn't play out as much like a movie as it does a pathetic excuse for approval, like the fat kid letting the bullies call him 'Chubs'	2010-12-23
Little Fockers arrives long after you thought every last bit of sort-of comic juice had been wrung out of this franchise. Everything and everyone - the actors as much as the script - is a bit hoarier.	2010-12-23
With some dreadfully unfunny scenes sprinkled with occasional comic highlights mainly involving Owen Wilson, this is barely passable stuff.	2010-12-23
The direction and writing are phoned in, and probably the art direction and location catering too. The whole film is on some sort of conference call.	2010-12-23
Just when you think things can't stoop any lower, Owen Wilson performs acrobatics in blue lycra.	2010-12-23
Everybody's clearly in it for the money in a follow-up that, sporadic chuckles aside, proves the law of diminishing returns.	2010-12-23
I enjoyed it hugely. It's nicely paced by a new director, Paul Weitz, but I reckon the key is in the writing.	2010-12-23
Nowhere near as good as 2000's Meet the Parents, but neither is it as dismal as the repetitive 2004 sequel Meet the Fockers.	2010-12-23
A lazy script makes for a cheesy and predictable film that features two crummy performances from stars who are hard to dislike.	2013-11-09
A ridiculous and lifeless comedy, this mess of a motion picture is trite and easily-forgettable.	2012-12-25
Robert Luketic's "Killers" takes a worn out premise and somehow manages to make it feel even more tired than before.	2012-09-24
A fluffy but harmless action comedy.	2010-10-30
Everything has a thrown-together feel, as the characters are tossed from romcom situations to action set-pieces and back again with no thought to applying any sort of grace notes to ease the transition.	2010-10-28
Robert Luketic's latest flick is a palette cleanser -- a flavourless sorbet if you will -- guaranteed to scrape the flavor of any recent enjoyable film from your sensory memory.	2010-10-21
Bland spy rom-com mines violence, stereotypes for laughs.	2010-09-07
Perhaps some future social scientist will explain why the traditional romantic comedy transformed during the first decade of the 21st century into the screwball action-comedy, in which bonds of love are strengthened by gunplay, car chases and explosions.	2010-08-20
Neither action nor romance, Killers will please all those who see it for Kutcher, disappoint those in search of a story.	2010-08-08
I was tested by Killers' gaping lack of a single distinguishing characteristic.	2010-08-04
The murderously boring Killers firmly belongs in the dregs of the ever increasing number of rom-com-action movies.	2010-08-03
A concept masquerading as a full blown movie, in which the story is undercooked but the delivery is overdone	2010-07-31
The storyline and script lack credibility, but more than that, Robert Luketic's direction misses the light, crisp fun the situations require, leaving us saddled with a questionable tone in Nowhereland	2010-07-31
Heigl and Kutcher's romance has about as much crackle as a bowl of soggy Rice Bubbles.	2010-07-30
Far from the knock out we hope for.	2010-07-29
full review at Movies for the Masses	2010-07-29
It's trying to be funny and it's trying to be cool but Killers doesn't quite get there.	2010-07-28
A bloated mess that's not remotely funny -- or suspenseful.	2010-07-27
The script is ludicrously overcooked, with too much unnecessary exposition at the expense of laughs, while Heigl's habitual decision to play each role as a nostril-flaring, wild-eyed, squealing shrew is growing tiresome.	2010-07-27
It's pretty much dead in the water as soon as a shirtless Kutcher tries to play suave and utters some terrible French in his first attempt to woo his co-star.	2010-07-06
Only the underplaying Selleck gets out of this with any dignity, while O'Hara is totally wasted as Jen's one-note tippling mom.	2010-07-06
Call us critics jaded, but Killers puts the "kill" in "kill-joy." Try it and see for yourself. Or not.	2010-06-28
Killers goes wrong so quickly and obviously it's almost hard to believe -- did collective deafness strike on set?	2010-06-24
The whole film is scripted like it didn't matter, and directed in a similar fashion.	2010-06-24
100 minutes killed, to be precise.	2010-06-22
Heigl and Kutcher are both easy on the eye but neither of them quite have the charisma required to overcome the flat script and uninspired direction.	2010-06-21
Vapid movie stars screeching their way through frantically edited action sequences.	2010-06-21
Killers feels like the build-up of Mr And Mrs Smith, only that's the whole movie and the chronic lack of a third act when even the second act is wafer thin is almost unforgivable.	2010-06-19
Kutcher and Heigl have such forced chemistry that it's hard to believe they'd ever fall in love, much less stay married in blissful blah-dom.	2010-06-18
It's us they are killing with this screamingly abysmal romcom-thriller, drearily similar to the hitman'n'her Brangelina picture Mr & Mrs Smith.	2010-06-17
What have moviegoers done to deserve releases like these?	2010-06-17
Kutcher and Heigl are unable to bring any warmth to what is at heart a bitter, cynical script. Just awful.	2010-06-16
It's better than The Bounty Hunter, with the two leads making a more charming couple than Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, but it's still difficult to view Killers as anything more than throwaway fluff.	2010-06-16
The script's bowel-rupturingly bland - you can almost sense the bits where they wrote [INSERT JOKE HERE] and never got round to it.	2010-06-16
Katherine Heigl and Robert Luketic are like The Osmond Siblings of the movie world.	2010-06-16
Heigl and Kutcher make a cute enough couple, but a cringeworthy opening and ludicrous (even by the standards of the genre) ending mean that this is one to watch only when your brain is switched to the "off" position.	2010-06-16
I laughed a few times and was fairly entertained. I just wish it had a better structure and not such a flat ending.	2010-06-16
A disjointed and unnecessarily lengthy comedy which has a number of flaws but still manages to garner enough laughs throughout to make it worth a watch.	2010-06-16
This should be and could be a really fun and entertaining, silly movie and it isn't.	2010-06-14
Certainly no worse - faint praise alert - than your average sitcom.	2010-06-14
A boobs 'n biceps fluffy espionage burb romance, helped in no small part by a host of unlikely everyday unneighborly assassins. Though a homicidal Kutcher, recently caught with his pants down as a conniving baby-faced gigolo in Spread, is another matter.	2010-06-12
Just how wretched an actress is Katherine Heigl? Ashton Kutcher has delivered his own share of poor performances, yet whenever he's asked to share a scene with Heigl, he comes across like Laurence Olivier by comparison.	2010-06-11
Killers is a lifeless romantic action comedy that might as well have been concocted in a broken beaker, given the paucity of chemistry between the lead actors.	2010-06-10
There is a potentially rich satirical situation there, as everyone in the couple's dull planned community turn out to be undercover killers. But whatever germ of an idea there is, it's quickly killed by witless writing and migraine-inducing direction.	2010-06-10
If you count the number of hairstyles Katherine Heigl wears in this dreary romcom-with-guns, the tally is likely to be four or five. Ashton Kutcher's facial expressions, one.	2010-06-10
If you think the trailers look bad, just imagine how insufferable the movie is.	2010-06-09
It's as if you'd tuned into an episode of Punk'd with Kutcher parading around in full Bond parody -- not good.	2010-06-09
This thing is a mess -- as a comedy, as a thriller, as an action vehicle, as a movie.	2010-06-09
This is not a bad movie. It is three bad movies. "Killers" is trying to be a romantic action comedy and it fails all three times.	2010-06-09
The comedic talents of Luketic, Kutcher, and Heigl overcome a dismal script, a ludicrous contrived setup, and innumerable plot holes.	2010-06-09
If the lazy filmmakers don't care enough about their movie to offer at least one single original idea, then you shouldn't care enough to go see it.	2012-02-10
This film plays it too safe and brings you only a smidgeon of charm and laughter.	2010-10-22
An uncomfortable journey for everyone involved.	2010-08-09
Though mixing espionage and family values in unraveling dysfunctional behavior among a bratty brood of siblings may be a stretch, Jackie Chan makes the most of it in his latest caper targeting unruly kids.	2010-05-30
This is the broad, silly kiddie exercise it appears to be.	2010-05-17
Lame.	2010-05-14
If you're still awake by the end credits, Chan's out-takes are sadly the funniest thing in this inane, silly and below-par effort. This one is for kids only.	2010-04-02
The woeful screenplay, the mundane direction, by Brian Levant, and the indifferent acting all combine to sink a stupid plot which should never have got off the ground.	2010-04-01
[The movie] is [likable], bringing a peppy energy to Bob's segue from international spy to babysitter.	2010-03-25
The slapstick comedy will amuse a young audience, but their parents will find it tedious.	2010-03-25
Definitely one for the kids to watch on their own when it comes out on DVD.	2010-03-22
Chan has just enough friendly charm to transcend this rubbish.	2010-03-22
Tongue-in-cheek entertainment...	2010-03-22
[It] may be a sign that age has finally caught up with this once most agile of action heroes.	2010-03-22
A movie that posits Billy Ray Cyrus as a techno-genius and allows the baddies to get away with Russian accents that would put most meerkats to shame.	2010-03-22
It starts slowly and ends very predictably. In fact, the bloopers which come before the end credits are probably the best thing about it -- and that says a lot.	2010-03-22
The results are always less than hilarious.	2010-03-22
Only Chan's charm saves it.	2010-03-22
The closing credit outtakes are the best part of this feeble effort.	2010-03-22
When people moan about the world's worst film-makers, the names Uwe Boll and Joel Schumacher invariably come up. If Brian Levant has escaped such infamy, it's only by sticking under the radar with kiddie-litter.	2010-03-19
This is hewn straight from the same, rickety old domestic-crisis formula which was never funny the first time round.	2010-03-19
Even the outtakes barely raise a smile.	2010-03-19
When even the out-take bloopers over the final credits are weak, you know you've got a pretty under-par Jackie Chan movie on your hands.	2010-03-19
Jackie Chan always guarantees a good time with his friendly manner combined with intricate fight stunts inventively choreographed and smoothly executed and this is no exception	2010-03-18
Filled with hilarious set ups, impossibly executed stunts plus an engaging central story about family and being loved, this funny action comedy is great entertainment for the whole family	2010-03-18
It's low on laughs and is almost undone by an irritating child performance from Will Shadley.	2010-03-17
Just normal, common- or-garden, ready-salted bad.	2010-03-16
Filled with slapstick guffaws, dodgy accents and copious pratfalls, Brian Levant's light-hearted action comedy succeeds because it stays true to what it actually is: a kids' movie.	2010-03-16
You have been warned.	2010-03-15
Chan is still likeable ... but he's on his own.	2010-02-05
Not as good as it should be but not as bad as I thought it would be, "The Spy Next Door" is an average actioner geared toward kids.	2010-02-02
The Spy Next Door is inane, but Jackie Chan manages to make it bearable.	2010-01-25
Chan's action moves are becoming a little rehearsed looking but the man still has charm	2010-01-24
When Jackie Chan gave up on acting and decided to retire, he didn't issue a press release, he made The Spy Next Door.	2010-01-21
The movie is, understandably, an incompetence pile.	2010-01-20
Tedious and tiresome, it's not surprising that the gag reel over the concluding credits is funnier than the 90 minutes that preceded it.	2010-01-18
This is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but it's still fun to watch Chan pull out all the stops to entertain us at an age when many actors have stopped trying.	2010-01-16
The Spy Next Door is bland, unassuming stuff for the kiddies. But few family films have Jackie Chan at their disposal.	2010-01-15
won't give the kiddies nightmares, but might make their parents long for a triple-feature of some of Chan's greatest hits once they get home	2010-01-15
Those old enough to resist can expect to be impressed anyway by the on-screen energy levels of both Chan and Valletta. They make their work look like fun.	2010-01-15
At some point, the social mores that functionally banned most other forms of ethnic stereotyping will catch up with the Slavs, a sad day indeed for middling screenwriters.	2010-01-15
Jackie Chan family flick high on stunts but low on laughs.	2010-01-15
Chan's comedic gifts and still-nimble moves are wasted in a string of unimaginative household calamities and practical jokes.	2010-01-15
As for Mr. Chan, he has some passably choreographed bits with folding chairs, a bicycle and, later, some pots and pans at Gillian's house. But it's hardly enough to redeem -- or even make bearable -- this half-hearted hodgepodge.	2010-01-15
It seemed as if all of the actors were reading their dialogue from a cue card. The Spy Next Door is already one of the worst films of 2010. Horrible.	2010-01-15
One wonders what sins Jackie Chan could have committed in a single lifetime to warrant having an abomination like this pathetic excuse for a movie weighing down his karma.	2010-01-15
Still fit and doing quite a few of his own stunts, Chan is an action hero with considerable charm.	2010-01-15
The script -- which took three people to write -- is barely coherent, and it's unclear whether Brian Levant was even on set when he directed. All that's left for us to enjoy are the action scenes, and frankly most of those are a little depressing.	2010-01-15
Chan is actually a fairly likeable hero and his elocution, never great, is at least passable in this latest romp.	2010-01-15
Duller than a Monday night at the cobweb museum...	2010-01-15
That the film is so convincing and so engaging despite the lack of dialogue is an unquantifiable triumph.	2014-01-13
The Artist is a joyous and enchanting film.	2014-01-13
The Artist doesn't talk, but it sings.	2014-01-13
The Artist is at turns funny, heartbreaking, thrilling and a visual marvel with only the aid of Ludovic Bource's sublime score to guide our reactions.	2014-01-13
Hazanavicius has reminded us of why we love the movies. He is sure to bring a smile to anyone who gambles on seeing this glorious throwback.	2014-01-13
Dujardin and Bejo have previously starred together in OSS 117: Cairo, A Nest of Spies, with the chemistry clearly already there, Hazanavicius was wise to cast them again.	2013-09-08
A modern-day classic that proves that Hollywood can still make incredible films.	2013-06-30
The whole thing is so damn clever and charming, it might just sneak off with Best Picture.	2013-06-20
Don't let the simplicity of the story fool you, 'The Artist' is a movie in which the pleasures lie entirely in the details.	2013-05-25
Possibly one of the most joyously enjoyable films to screen in the Cannes competition -- especially for lovers of classic Hollywood cinema -- The Artist is a real pleasure.	2013-02-15
Had The Artist been made 75 years ago, it might have been brushed aside as melodrama. Today, its affection for a lost past strikes the right note of wistful nostalgia.	2013-02-15
It isn't arty or intellectual, though it is artful and ingenious, and it's the rare crowd-pleaser that never feels obvious or pandering.	2013-02-15
Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist manages the trick of being both fearlessly loyal to an era of cinema that's long since passed and one of the few original motion pictures of its own time.	2013-02-15
There is literally nothing wrong with it. I don't have a single nit to pick, minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me. It is pure magic from the first frame to the last.	2013-02-15
Its retro-retro take uniquely delivers the most crucial element of the moviegoing experience, the art of entertainment.	2012-10-22
I could spend hours talking about how fantastic The Artist is; how sublime Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are; how natural their movements and expressions are; how perfect the score is - oh, the score, so expressive and lively and jovial and magical.	2012-09-28
Hazanavicius has perfectly captured the look and feel of the silent era with "The Artist."	2012-09-18
The Artist is apparently Hazanavicius' dream project and it's truly inspiring to see a filmmaker take such a big risk in this day and age: especially when it pays off so big.	2012-09-15
As an homage to silent films, it works. As a cinematic narrative of classic quality, it falls short.	2012-09-15
The Artist is superfluous, but charming through-and-through, painted with lively performances, staggering cinematography and a lovely spirit of nostalgia.	2012-06-29
Every now and then in an age of darkness and cynicism, a life affirming film is just what we need.	2012-06-28
I'm not sure how much replay this film will get, but a first viewing is awfully satisfying-though it makes the audience work a little harder than they're accustomed.	2012-06-26
There appears to be one last goodbye, one last spotlight, for an industry that should never have left us in the first place.	2012-06-21
The Academy Awards are the biggest annual party that Hollywood throws for itself, and The Artist is a movie that worships Hollywood. Looks like a done deal.	2012-06-15
a witty, self-aware pastiche, full of clever audiovisual gags and cinephiliac allusions, with irresistible charm coursing through its nostalgic veins.	2012-05-31
Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius toys with despair only to gloss over it.	2012-04-30
...it gives us a glimpse of what those silly people in black-and-white ... must have found so thrilling, engaging and ultimately heartening when they watched those quaint gray ghosts dancing on a screen they imagined was silver, so unrecoverably long ago.	2012-04-29
It's a screaming endorsement to the power of cinema... without saying a word.	2012-04-29
'The Artist' is a masterpiece.	2012-04-21
You can't fault it as smart entertainment, which eschews parody to make a sincere tribute that also serves as cogent current commentary.	2012-04-17
Whether you see the 'The Artist' for its nostalgia or its novelty, its joyous spirit is undeniable.	2012-04-16
"The Artist" drags, as any film telling its story with its mouth and ears tied behind its back can be expected to. But it's a lovely bit of froth, the meringue on a cinema season that is both high-minded and awards oriented.	2012-03-23
Goofily gorgeous, heartfelt and endlessly rewatchable, this is the true meaning of escapism - a doorway to another world, a world created to entertain eyes, heart and brain.	2012-03-22
Warts and all, The Artist reminds us that the fire is far from extinguished.	2012-03-20
The Artist is a freakishly good one-off - I'd hate to call it a fluke, but it's unlikely someone could replicate this approach to such great effect in the near future.	2012-03-15
A wonderful experience but if your mind isn't open to the idea of a silent film you might want to give it a miss. There are big rewards for those willing to investigate. You might have a new appreciation for the art of filmmaking.	2012-03-08
This is by far the best film of the year, an instant classic, which embodies the very essence of cinema. If we, in Northern Ireland, are not screening this sensational film then we might as well shut down all our cinemas.	2012-03-08
The movie ever fully shakes off its air of skillfully executed experiment, but it's spirited and charming nonetheless.	2012-03-07
An occasion when style really does triumph over substance.	2012-02-27
It may look like an art film, but it's anything but. It's a good, old-fashioned, formulaic, Hollywood romantic comedy rise-and-fall story told with a modern sensibility and easily accessible by mainstream audiences.	2012-02-23
En pleno 2012, entre el auge de las vistosas superproducciones en 3D y la sobresaturacion de videos en YouTube, una pelicula muda y en blanco y negro logra entretener y emocionar como lo hacian hace 90 anos.	2012-02-16
Mais que uma brincadeira com o periodo, e tambem uma homenagem doce, ingenua e profundamente divertida a Setima Arte e aos seus incorrigiveis amantes.	2012-02-14
Dujardin and Bejo light up the screen. It's easy to believe them as movie idols from a bygone era.	2012-02-14
It's a deliriously, wondrously, unspeakably fabulous film.	2012-02-05
You're likely to be as smiling as much as George Valentin.	2012-02-02
As frothy, upbeat tales of old Hollywood go, it's superb, full of small delights and general sunshine.	2012-02-01
A good, but not great film, it's plot seemingly derived from well-known films about films made back in the 1950s such as 'Singin' in the Rain'.	2012-02-01
If you want to see some spectacularly adorable if not particularly lasting or memorable dog tricks, The Artist is the film you've been waiting for.	2012-01-31
Hazanavicius has woven together a variety of cinematic styles from different eras to make a silent film that is easily accessible to a contemporary audience.	2012-01-30
Its appeal lies in its innate ability of tapping into that sense of joy that lies within us all. It is irresistibly charming. It is unmissable.	2012-01-29
if you find yourself reaching for the Kleenex during the film's final emotionally charged minutes, you most definitely won't be alone.	2013-06-02
[E]xtraordinary in how it turns upside-down the typical feel-good, triumph-of-the-underdogs tropes of the subgenre...	2012-11-15
A reminder of the power of good in a world where most people get too caught up in superficial matters. A wonderful documentary that will point life's purpose in the right direction.	2012-10-10
Undefeated is far more interested in the resilience of the human spirit than one hundred yards of green turf.	2012-09-27
Undefeated is all heart. Even those who couldn't care less about American Football will find this an affecting story about a man who really gives one hell of a damn.	2012-08-06
It's an affecting and encouraging story.	2012-08-05
Even if you have no interest in American football this is a compelling and inspirational story that brings a tear to the eye.	2012-08-03
All eyes are on the ball, while the future screams from the sidelines.	2012-08-02
Undefeated works the whole macho-sentimental template so vigorously and well it's practically a reflexive response to cry foul, but you'd have to find heroic reserves of cynicism not to care at all about the precarious fortunes of these unformed bruisers.	2012-08-02
A watchable movie, no question. But perhaps best filed under guilty pleasures.	2012-08-02
Can take its place proudly alongside the best in the genre.	2012-08-02
Gripping, well made and genuinely inspirational documentary that packs a powerful emotional punch, even if some of the scenes seem suspiciously contrived for maximum tear-jerking purposes.	2012-08-01
'Undefeated' is no 'Hoop Dreams', but it's sturdily built and worthwhile.	2012-07-31
It may be a film that feels rather than analyses, but Undefeated is a compelling, uplifting experience that can't fail to move even the most US football-phobic.	2012-07-30
This is a valuable story from what one interview subject aptly refers to as the 'have-nots' of one of America's richest sports.	2012-07-25
As far as American Football flicks go, it's the closest to touching the greatness of H.G. Bissinger's tome Friday Night Lights and Michael Lewis' The Blind Side.	2012-07-05
Not only does the truth set one free but also acknowledging unpleasant realities sometimes makes the platitudes seem like more than something off a locker room poster.	2012-05-26
Where the season takes them, and the entire team, is a satisfying mix of sports-movie uplift and heartbreaking realism.	2012-05-16
In truth, the story that unfolds is better than the filmmakers' sometimes overwrought attempts to frame it ...	2012-04-29
With a story that proves to be heartwarming and predictable, Undefeated mostly plays according to the script familiar in its fiction and nonfiction counterparts.	2012-04-21
Even though the film relies on many of the cliches of the form, Undefeated is a masterfully crafted work that honestly scores a touchdown.	2012-04-06
"Undefeated" doesn't have a deep penetration of poverty and race in its playbook, but it does have enough heart to make substantial forward progress.	2012-04-06
It's a surprisingly moving, emotional film, even for those who (like me) know little of football; by its end, you just might be blinking away a few tears.	2012-03-29
Peers empathetically into a tiny world and opens it up for its audience, who, in turn, will surely open their hearts to it.	2012-03-29
Combines the gritty reality of "Hoop Dreams" and the heart of "Friday Night Lights," along with a dash of "The Blind Side."	2012-03-29
Volunteer high school coach Bill Courtney says, "Football doesn't build character. Football reveals character." The triumphant sports documentary "Undefeated" proves that it does both.	2012-03-20
For all its good intentions, the film, like its main subject, is a tourist, earning trust as it earnestly captures the incredible struggles of these young men, but never digging deep enough to actually make the story theirs.	2012-03-19
A touching documentary that offers a field-level portrait of male mentorship, compassion and unvarnished hope - all without a Hollywood ending.	2012-03-16
[A] winning documentary.	2012-03-16
It is a powerful reminder of the difference one person can make -- and of the consequences when no one is willing to make that difference.	2012-03-16
What lifts 'Undefeated' above other sports docs is the remarkable force of Bill Courtney's personality.	2012-03-16
It may call to mind The Blind Side or Remember the Titans, but there's no Hollywood glitz in the blighted burg of Manassas.	2012-03-16
[A] stirring, emotional portrait of a high school football team in the impoverished neighborhood of North Memphis, Tenn.	2012-03-16
It's a bit too long and a bit too vague at times, but this is a film about dedication, progress and the bond of human effort. It just also happens to include football.	2012-03-16
"Undefeated'' needs less of what we know we've seen (the football stuff) and more of the players' and coaches' lives, which even if we feel we've seen, we haven't.	2012-03-15
What makes this a terrific film is how much we care about the players.	2012-03-15
I regret that we don't meet more of Courtney's players, but that might have required a miniseries rather than a movie. And "Undefeated" makes sure the coach who is its central figure is more complex and fascinating than most fictional movie characters.	2012-03-15
...an inspirational and often touching film that lets us get to know a dedicated coach who has faith in his players and delivers what he promises (almost).	2012-03-14
This is a film that doesn't cater only to the traditional football fan.	2012-03-09
Courtney really does believe all that stuff about adversity and character, and the film is moving for its modest tale of boys learning to act like men.	2012-03-08
In introducing us to [Coach] Courtney...Undefeated finds its voice	2012-03-05
Just like a well-fought playoff win, it'll leave you a little misty-eyed.	2012-03-05
This is one of the best sports documentaries of the last few years and while I don't think it should have won in a VERY good year for non-fiction film, I'm really not upset at all that it did.	2012-03-02
Finds the warmth and vulnerability that is sometimes hard for outsiders to see beneath the rough, damaged exterior of the impoverished Memphis neighborhood where much of the action takes place.	2012-03-02
The hardened inner-city kids here are far more authentic than anything Hollywood can offer, and as a result the film has a raw emotional weight that commercial features rarely achieve.	2012-03-02
Undefeated does more to draw a straight line between the desire to win (as opposed to actually winning) and the character of a man than a thousand locker room pep talks.	2012-03-02
This film is distinctly minor league. But it does provide the thumbs-up emotional lift of a bumper-sticker message on game day.	2012-03-02
This year's Oscar winner for Best Documentary Feature seems almost too good to be true...but that's what makes it so effective.	2012-03-01
It's a credit to directors Daniel Lindsay and T.J. Daniels that the personal stories of the kids and coaches resonate more than the wins and losses.	2012-03-01
Undefeated is undeniably inspirational stuff.	2012-03-01
You cannot watch the film without feeling kinship with the characters and admitting their decency as well as their mistakes.	2013-06-19
Ambiguous endings can work for some films, but it doesn't here. Still, the powerful performances and near seamless screenplay leave little else to be desired. A Separation deserves its Oscar.	2013-04-21
A case study in how simplicity can produce spectacular results that extend far beyond a film's budget.	2012-08-25
[A] flawless domestic portrait.	2012-08-05
... a complex and nuanced movie about the ... the collapse of a relationship between intelligent people of good will. It is heartbreaking and subtle, the sort of film that some folks say isn't made often or well enough by the usual Hollywood suspects.	2012-04-29
A Separation infuses a great insight into modern Iran with a powerful insight into the human condition - this demonstrates the power and poetic potential of cinematic drama. It's a MUST see.	2012-04-26
Writer-director Asghar Farhadi performs some kind of miracle with the tension and complexity he produces from such a simple set-up.	2012-04-25
...riveting, enormously resonant and impressively acted...	2012-04-19
Fahardi's accomplishment is to have brought to the screen a group of equally complex, equally flawed, and equally human characters whose only real problem is that they must live life with each other.	2012-04-02
Offers an unwritten ending that must be decided by each viewer.	2012-04-02
... subtlety and a sense of profound decency ...	2012-03-20
A clever, insightful and heartfelt examination of human frailty that makes watching subtitles seem like a breeze.	2012-03-11
It's fast paced, exciting, thrilling, edgy, moving, engaging, and - in its portrait of a justice system almost radically alien to the one I live under - absolutely fascinating.	2012-03-11
Although the film might serve as a portrait of Iran's two conflicting social groups as reflected in the Green movement/Ahmadinejad clashes, it is much more about moral contradictions that any society has to face. A masterpiece.	2012-03-11
It's the little moments in Farhadi's film that are its most important, speaking every bit as loudly as its big, narrative-driving moments.	2012-03-09
Dynamically shot and paced like a thriller, the film has the density and moral prickliness of a good novel.	2012-03-07
If any one film can re-inject life into an entire national cinema, it's A Separation.	2012-03-07
You may also find that some aspects of this very foreign story seem disturbingly not all that foreign.	2012-03-07
Nothing earth-shattering happens in A Separation, but the straightforwardness of this view of a disintegrating marriage, set in the context of complicated cultural and religious mores, is dramatic by itself.	2012-03-06
An outsider could see these characters as misguided. That's not the reality however. Farhadi slips us into their shoes and we appreciate each of their perspectives.	2012-03-05
Asghar Farhadi has written a superb screenplay and directs it with equal brilliance. He has managed to make a film that says something about the state of affairs in his Iran and weaves that message into an engrossing tapestry of mystery and drama.	2012-03-04
The complex realities of human emotions and experience are more than sufficient to carry a film, and Farhadi doesn't let fussy direction or attempts to be overly clever get in the way of letting this brilliant, quietly insightful story unfold.	2012-03-04
A clarion cry that cuts through the xenophobic clutter and the dense fog of war to show that not everyone "over there" is a boogeyman waiting to jump out of the closet. If that sounds terribly simplistic, just consider where we live.	2012-03-02
A Separation is more than a character study; it's a deftly plotted drama that unfolds layer after layer and will leave you asking all kinds of questions about your beliefs and moral judgments. Fascinating stuff.	2012-03-02
The story has no winners, and the daringly ambiguous ending defies simple conclusions. Even the title can be taken multiple ways.	2012-03-02
The movie opens the door on a foreign culture, yet the people do not seem that dissimilar. .... They deal with some of the same struggles ... -- generational and class conflicts, ideological differences, and connecting and communicating emotionally.	2012-03-02
A devastating portrait of two families in crisis, with their class differences representing the title's true 'separation.'	2012-03-02
"A Separation" deals with some very murky issues, but it does so with astonishing clarity.	2012-03-01
The movie is a singular mix of the foreign and the familiar, but is it the best 2011 film in the whole wide world? A 99? I can't say that I concur with my colleagues on that score.	2012-02-29
A Separation explores how presumed social norms are extremely tenuous and how threats to these almost illusory ideas can threaten our sense of personal security.	2012-02-27
Farhadi does not talk down to his viewer, and he trusts his audience to make their own decisions.	2012-02-26
The performances and direction match the sharply observed screenplay, which is layered and nuanced, never settling for the pat answer. Indeed, it avoids answers as much as it can, giving audiences a far more interactive experience than most films	2012-02-25
Thought provoking and powerful drama. One action becomes the trigger for the unravelling that filmmaker Asghar Farhadi explores: secrets, lies and truths are exposed	2012-02-25
a brilliant, mesmerizing drama, incredibly well-acted by its ensemble cast	2012-02-25
One of A Separation's many virtues is the way it gradually reveals, Rashomon-like, the complicated facts, half-truths, and lies that each character tells for perfectly legitimate reasons.	2012-02-24
Finely crafted drama teems with conflicts involving class, generations, mental health and good old fashioned lying.	2012-02-24
These people seem so real they might live next door. And they probably do.	2012-02-23
What is a sin? What is right? When is it okay to lie? All these questions swirl in a movie that might possibly be the best foreign language film at this year's Academy Awards.	2012-02-17
"A Separation" is a plaintive fable of the human condition that unites us.	2012-02-17
One of the year's best reveals life in Iran	2012-02-16
A tragically familiar family drama whose heartbreaking "for want of a nail" sequence of events spirals out of control at an intimate and individual level.	2012-02-16
A Separation shows the human struggle for respect and a better life. It's a struggle rife with human frailty. Asghar Farhadi is a sly writer and director, and leaves us with questions that are provocative and elusive.	2012-02-13
Very few movies capture as convincingly as A Separation does the ways in which seemingly honorable decisions can lead to interpersonal conflict -- even disaster.	2012-02-10
Smart, provocative, and brimming with ungovernable human emotions.	2012-02-10
To say the piercing Iranian film A Separation is about divorce is a bit like saying The Wizard of Oz is about a pair of slippers.	2012-02-09
A meandering, nerve-wracking, ultimately worthwhile tour of contemporary Iranian urban life.	2012-02-03
Above all, Farhadi&rsquo;s parable teaches that a rush to judgment inevitably turns back on the judge.	2012-02-03
It's a portrait of an essential and sympathetic human dilemma, and in that it's both real and timeless in ways that transcend borders, cultures and languages.	2012-02-02
"A Separation" moves beyond one couple's sundering marriage to reveal growing rifts between generations, ideologies, religious mind-sets, genders and classes in contemporary Iran.	2012-02-02
Is it possible, the movie asks, that children, with their belief in absolutes, have purer moral compasses than their forced-to-compromise parents?	2012-02-02
Serving as both a wondrous stroll down your childhood and a fantastic introduction to Kermit and company, this is a warmly inspired nostalgia kick that will delight both longtime fans and endear the franchise to a new generation.	2014-04-18
What is a Muppet? Is it something one is born? Is it something one chooses? Is it a state of mind? Is it a lifestyle?	2014-03-19
The Muppets never went away, and "The Muppets" is a celebration of that. It's time to play the music, and it's time to light the lights.	2013-06-22
The giddiness that Jim Henson & Friends brought to the original Muppets is missing. The antic energy, the old vaudeville/TV variety show references are just plain alien to modern kids.	2012-12-28
A Muppet film that not only lives up to the franchise legacy and, for some, might just end up being one of their all-time favorite adventures with Kermit and the gang.	2012-10-02
The muppets are back, just like we remember them, with catchy tunes and meta humor. Also, a great cast of cameo appearances is paired with a fun story and iconic characters that haven't been detrimentally modernized.	2012-09-22
A luminous and loving tribute to the man who breathed life into nothing but felt and faux fur.	2012-09-04
Marvellous. The Muppets manages to revitalise the family classic to create a hilarious and life-affirming delight.	2012-06-27
You can tell that these filmmakers grew up cherishing what was best about the Muppets. ... From the script to the colors to the body language, it all has Henson's heartbeat.	2012-06-15
As a died-in-the-wool Muppets fan, this overripe nostalgia trip only almost captures that Henson magic. There are moments of exhuberance, but they're scattered and isolated.	2012-05-02
An energetic return to form reminding audiences, both young and old, why everyone should love The Muppets.	2012-04-04
Everything here just works. Its weird, colorful world is breath of cinema fresh air. The Muppets is a world where you just have to believe that these "muppets" are real and not question the whys and how of it.	2012-03-28
If you're not a joyless maniac with a soul of anthracite then you will work hard to imagine how this project could have been better handled.	2012-03-19
Warrants multiple viewings. I am currently considering raising my children on this film. If you don't come out feeling complete joy, you might want to check with your parents that they didn't find you in a crashed spaceship in a cornfield.	2012-03-08
Disney's "The Muppets" is a solid family movie that breathes new life into an old franchise. Who'd have thought that were even possible?	2012-03-08
full review at Movies for the Masses	2012-02-17
Beneath the cleverness you'll find warmth, sweetness and real affection for our fine felt friends.	2012-02-13
Henson's Muppets had a nice line in dry wit. They were anarchic. Segel's are corporate stooges.	2012-02-13
During The Muppets' numerous highlights, movie-going is rarely this much fun.	2012-02-13
The film's broad smiles and big-heartedness are bracingly disingenuous, the self-referential jokes well handled. Only the affection emanating from the audience is sincere.	2012-02-11
If, like me, you are a parent, there will be something life affirming about taking your children to see these ageless old friends.	2012-02-10
Welcome back, Muppets.	2012-02-10
Director Bobin milks laughter and tears in generous, equal measures, leaving us hankering for more.	2012-02-10
I hope this movie will bring these talented artistes back to the forefront of the entertainment industry. It deserves to.	2012-02-09
We defy anyone over the age of 30 not to get emotional when the lights do go up and Kermit takes the stage ...	2012-02-09
Unfortunately the pang of loss - the "you can't go back again" - is reflected in the film's own inability go back again. After a meditative midsection it tries to re-establish cuteness and comic zeal.	2012-02-09
Kermit, we're sorry we forgot about you - never leave again.	2012-02-09
Kermit the Frog rounds up the gang to save the Muppets' derelict old theatre from a ruthless tycoon in this laugh-out-loud return to the enduring TV characters' roots.	2012-02-09
A witty script, catchy songs, strong comic performances and a host of delightfully funny celebrity cameos.	2012-02-08
Witty, affectionate and charmingly silly.	2012-02-08
The most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational comeback fans could have hoped for.	2012-02-08
A film bursting at the seams with sheer, unadulterated joy: watch it, and the world seems just that little bit brighter...	2012-02-07
Made absolutely for grown-up fans, this is the Muppets as you fondly remember them: funny, smart and gleefully insane.	2012-02-05
The sunniest, happiest film in the world - and if the under-10 in your life can't appreciate that, it might be time to put them up for adoption.	2012-01-30
settle down for something wondrous, and wondrously artificial - an hour and a half of proof that the Dream Factory can still squeeze out more than one happy song to sing along.	2012-01-29
So genial, so joyous, and suffused with such a lip-smacking sweetness, that the occasional pacing issues and subplot hiccups simply don't seem to matter.	2012-01-27
It's never cloying or too knowing. Cynicism and wariness are real world concerns that have no place among the foam and felt.	2012-01-26
Brushing aside decades of nostalgia, this is a whip-smart postmodern romp with a warm heart to boot, and as such, it should please both life-long fans and new initiates to the Muppet universe.	2012-01-25
invites viewers to become a bit like the dreamer Walter and, in (re)discovering and embracing their inner child (not to mention their inner muppet), to join a fantastic, funny family that never grows old, no matter how times may have changed.	2012-01-23
The innocence is slightly twisted, the harmonious camaraderie is slightly corrosive and the characters are slightly eccentric	2012-01-12
I smiled throughout this madcap joyous adventure in which the Muppets are funny, silly, colourful and totally endearing in what must be the happiest film of the New Year	2012-01-12
MY inner child - the one who loved The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper - really wants to give this film five stars.	2012-01-12
By focusing on the Muppets of The Muppet Show (1976-1981) rather than the independent Muppets of prior films, the writers open up an unexplored aspect of Muppet lore ripe for revival.	2012-01-11
Everybody loves the Muppets and this happy mix of live-action and puppet chaos is perfect entertainment for every age.	2012-01-09
A nice throwback to the good old days of the Muppets.	2012-01-05
Under James Bobin's direction, however, the outing feels cheap and strangely small-screen.	2012-01-04
An altogether charming, smart and strangely moving little movie.	2012-01-04
The Muppets may be one of the best films of the year, not judged as a children's film, or a family film, but instead, simply as a film.	2012-01-03
The Muppets is really two movies. And one of those movies is quite good, albeit awfully similar to previous films.	2012-01-03
Even balcony critics Waldorf and Statler would have a hard time faulting this Wonkaful delight.	2012-01-03
For about $1,000 every two weeks, these people try to make a concrete, palpable change in a community that fights them at every turn. What's amazing is not whether or not they're effective; what's amazing is that they even try at all.	2013-06-22
If the lack of progress in Chicago is upsetting, the reassurance of James' unparalleled talent is inspiring. He is not just one of the United States' most vital and humane filmmakers, but one of the world's.	2012-07-05
The Interrupters is a heavyweight film about a heavyweight subject of clear interest well beyond the United States.	2012-06-18
It's lazy critical shorthand to point out that good documentaries often feature better characterizations than even the best fiction films, but The Interrupters certainly justifies such a cliche.	2012-06-11
The cameras take us where few people dare go.	2012-02-26
The revelations and examples of this positive influence seeping into the skin of the city creates enormous cinematic and community excitement.	2012-02-26
Much like the director's seminal doc, this is a richly-drawn slice of real life that's weaved with the finesse of a fine Hollywood drama.	2012-01-25
Present[s] a gratifyingly non-cynical take on the troubles facing the species, uplifting without being cloying.	2011-12-14
Though formally conventional, it carries a powerful message about the reality of life in the inner city and the struggles of thise who live there to break the cycle of violence.	2011-12-09
Reality movie-making at a high point.	2011-12-09
Ameena Matthews, Cobe Williams and Eddie Bocanegra used to instigate Chicago street violence. Now they live for nipping it in the bud, block by treacherous block.	2011-12-08
The courage, determination and intelligence of these violence interrupters is inspiring, but even more inspiring are the people trying so hard to overcome this plague of violence and live decent lives.	2011-12-03
Chronicles 'one year in the life of a city grappling with violence,' when Chicago was labeled a 'war zone.' Laments a funeral home director: 'How can the President of the United States be a black man... but I'm still burying black kids?'	2011-11-17
A cry of hope from communities of despair.	2011-11-11
James and Kotlowitz are unsparing in their depiction of how rough life in Chicago's mean streets can get. Nonetheless, they also have a deep compassion for the people they follow.	2011-10-21
The Interrupters is a film that offers an unflinching look at urban violence but also introduces a ray of hope.	2011-10-07
Where James's film excels is as direct experiential cinema -- without narration, onscreen interviews or acknowledgment of the presence of the camera -- it is an intensely dramatic window into a world.	2011-10-07
There are moments when The Interrupters feels like a real-life version of The Wire, with weary heroes trudging forever uphill to make their ugly world a slightly better place. The problem is that it's a very repetitive film.	2011-10-07
A sobering but not hopeless look at how the Windy City is attempting to turn around a rising tide of street shooting, through the work of a unique group called CeaseFire.	2011-10-06
It's a year in the life and death of the fight against the streetwise status quo, and James' doc brings it all horrifically home.	2011-09-30
I don't get to vote on the Nobel Peace Prize, but my imaginary vote would go to the Violence Interrupters, the real-life "stars" of the documentary "The Interrupters."	2011-09-23
Like Hoop Dreams, the movie doesn't really have an ending, but it doesn't have a beginning, either. It simply observes a year in the life of a city, and a community that's made it their mission to deal with a difficult situation.	2011-09-17
There's no doubt The Interrupters do some good; but there's also no doubt the problem they're facing is enormous.	2011-09-16
Realistically inspiring and, thankfully, not overly dramatized.	2011-09-16
The immediacy and caprice of violence in "The Interrupters'' are just as strong as in nearly every documentary I've seen about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.	2011-09-15
There will be tears shed over this deep look at Chicago's grisliest streets and the benevolent soldiers who fight to keep them safe.	2011-09-13
If this were a fiction movie out of Hollywood, we'd be hooting at the preposterousness of it all. I mean, really.	2011-09-13
Through understanding and fearlessness, this brave trio shows us, the world can be changed, tiny step by tiny step.	2011-09-08
James' camera investigates the story in the same detailed, organic manner he used in Hoop Deams.	2011-09-06
A massive and compelling tapestry of life on the streets of Chicago.	2011-09-05
James pokes through viewers' humdrum haze, interrupting their routine and reminding them that there exists a grey and very complicated world in desperate need of workable solutions, not ideological posturing.	2011-09-02
"The Interrupters" is an intense and chilling documentary about peacekeeping troops in a war zone.	2011-09-01
...it is an eye-opening document that leaves you feeling hopeful because such people as Ameena, Cobe and Eddie exist.	2011-08-28
In the end, statistics are of less moment to this movie than the case-by-case personal successes that, in some cases, are emotionally overwhelming.	2011-08-27
Tense, moving, and, at times brain-draining.	2011-08-26
A heartbreaking, empowering documentary about inner-city violence...	2011-08-26
A staggering movie about a reality so dark and painful and real that it almost crushes the mind to think about it.	2011-08-25
It tears at your heart with its depiction of the intractability of the problem. But it simultaneously insists, and makes you believe, that change is possible one person at a time.	2011-08-25
"The Interrupters" is solid proof that James really is a gifted documentarian who can hit hard when he's got the right story to tell, and it's an important look at people doing selfless, challenging work that puts them in harm's way every single day.	2011-08-24
Demands your attention, all the while demonstrating what great documentary filmmaking is all about - a hopeful vehicle for change.	2011-08-24
...a triumph of evidence on how one person's actions can begin a groundswell of change.	2011-08-23
James' Hoop Dreams has been spoken of with reverence and wonder for 17 years; now, he has an equal to its reputation.	2011-08-22
The most heroic figures you're likely to see on screen all year.	2011-08-19
The Interrupters, a documentary about an initiative to stop urban violence in Chicago, may be the most necessary film you'll see this year.	2011-08-19
In a documentary career defined by fierce commitment to his subjects, Steve James delivers his most ambitious project yet in The Interrupters.	2011-08-19
Steve James' arresting documentary could benefit even more from a multi-part television treatment.	2011-08-19
The Interrupters is a heavyweight film about a heavyweight subject of clear interest well beyond the United States.	2011-08-16
It's an encouraging film, though its overall context in an America 50 years after the election of Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson is depressing.	2011-08-15
...a sobering look at an endemic American disease of poverty that squeezes lower class minorities into abject depression and violence.	2011-08-13
Searing in its depiction of at-risk children in poor communities, the film is also the bracing, life-affirming story of residents who are beginning to reclaim their streets, one corner at a time.	2011-08-12
This smart doc should prove the perfect summer antidote to most of summer's films that require you to turn your brain off to enjoy them.	2013-07-10
If there's one thing Marsh knows, it's how to reach your deepest emotions. He did it with 'Man on Wire,' and he does it again here.	2013-05-25
A fascinating, unflinching and tragic documentary about the chimpanzee we tried to make human.	2013-03-04
A tragic chronicle of animal abuse.	2012-02-20

One of the 10 best films of 2011.	2012-01-16
This is one of those great documentaries which could be transposed almost without change into a heartbreaking Hollywood tearjerker.	2012-01-09
This haunting life story is an exquisite example of non-fiction filmmaking as full-bodied, emotionally complex drama.	2012-01-04
There is no question Nim was exploited for human gain, yet there are important aspects which Marsh leaves unexplored.	2011-12-09
Nim's story is so fascinating and telling... that it would probably be impossible for even the very worst of filmmakers to screw it up, and Marsh is not the worst of filmmakers.	2011-12-09
Writer-director James Marsh mines yet another long-forgotten slice of '70s madness.	2011-12-07
It is the sad story of an animal whose fate is left in the hands of people--some well-meaning, some not so much--who are error-prone, unprepared for dealing with a chimpanzee, and often uncaring.	2011-11-14
In a way, Nim's life journey mirrors our own, particularly if we end up alone, no longer having much control over what happens to us.	2011-11-12
Tales of the attacks Nim inflicted on his many carers are horrific, but there is a pervasive sense there was nothing else they could have expected.	2011-10-18
Project Nim nimbly serves up a profoundly sad tale that raises as many thought-provoking questions as it answers.	2011-10-07
This tale of a hard done by chip places a light on when unethical scientific research and the post 1960s counterculture combine to create an experiment done wrong in Project Nim.	2011-10-02
...succeeds as theater, as entertainment, but it doesn't really attempt what Terrace tried, in his admittedly morally clumsy way. What is the light in those feral eyes and what does it mean? Can we ever hope to know?	2011-10-01
The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim's keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?	2011-09-30
Funny at times, but also deeply sad, it's a truly fascinating and well made documentary.	2011-09-29
Marsh's film is as much a study of how we behave as a species as it is of what happens to Nim. And we don't come off particularly well.	2011-09-29
Project Nim tells a sweet, strange and sad story of an incredible creature that will touch even the hardest of hearts.	2011-09-29
A bizarre, captivating and somewhat sad new documentary.	2011-09-29
Driven by James Marsh's measured storytelling style, this ethically unsettling and emotionally compelling documentary is the equal of any cinematic epic.	2011-09-29
A thought-proving and entirely moving portrait of human arrogance -- in general and with some very, very specific examples.	2011-09-23
Marsh knows this material is explosive, so he presents it simply and with little sentiment (against all odds, "Nim" is frequently very funny).	2011-09-16
For a movie about an ape, it sheds an interesting light on humanity. Animals may be wild, but only humans are cruel.	2011-09-08
Project Nim doesn't try to reconcile its different understandings of Nim -- as an experiment, a child, a projection of various selves, and a complex, independent being.	2011-09-08
Marsh is too content framing the entire film around the narrative spun by its subjects, rather than stamping his own authorship on the film, and as a result it lacks the power and depth of his previous work.	2011-09-02
After watching this eye-opening documentary, one almost hopes for a rebellion of the chimpanzees like the one seen in the latest installment in the Planet of the Apes franchise.	2011-08-16
About as far as you can get from cinema verite in its artful combination of archive material, existing documentary footage, newly filmed interviews and dramatic reconstruction, to trace Nim's strange progress.	2011-08-15
I was very moved by this film.	2011-08-13
Despite some heartbreak in the last half, this film brims with humanity and some priceless humour, too.	2011-08-12
The release of this documentary by James Marsh in the same week as Rise of the Planet of the Apes is wittily timed. It too speaks of caged primates, though its judgement on their captors is far more disturbing.	2011-08-12
This many-faceted time capsule sheds little light, but buried inside it are vexing questions and the still-beating heart of a special creature.	2011-08-12
Marsh, who made the multi-awarded Man on a Wire, takes no sides but lets the humans speak for themselves, rum lot that they are.	2011-08-12
A corrective to all those family films and documentaries, many of them by Disney, that sentimentalise - and patronise - wild animals by trying to turn them into quirky, mentally subnormal humans.	2011-08-11
Marsh's poignant film showcases the best and worst instincts of human nature and tells an extraordinary tale.	2011-08-11
You end up fearing for the humans who contact him. At the same time, you feel his rage.	2011-08-11
The chimp comes out of it well. Homo sapiens, of course, is found wanting.	2011-08-11
In Project Nim Marsh is much less concerned with the scientific results of the study than he is with the behavior of the human beings involved, particularly Dr. Terrace whose behavior was, to put it mildly, not a credit to his species.	2011-08-11
As a cinema experience, Project Nim was never likely to reach the heights of Marsh's Man on Wire, but the eccentricities of his story made it well worth telling.	2011-08-11
One of the best documentaries of the year.	2011-08-11
A documentary, stunningly watchable, about the 1970s American research team that explored the "educability" of a chimpanzee.	2011-08-11
The saddest part is seeing him being given to a family with no expertise with animals or sign language and then having to adapt to too many different and increasingly restrictive types of lifestyles as he's moved from one place to another.	2011-08-11
Intriguing yet ineffably sad, what emerges is not the story of an ape who failed to be human, but a story of human failings.	2011-08-10
Nim's journey is profoundly moving...	2011-08-10
You're left with the impression that, despite not being able to grasp basic human grammar, perhaps Nim was unwittingly conditioned into understanding the concept of love.	2011-08-09
Gives us jolt of clarity into our 'playing God' actions, one filled initially with both hope then despair that ultimately makes you ashamed to be human.	2011-08-09
Gripping, heart-wrenching, powerful and a sad indictment of scientific practice, which shows that 'human' and 'humane' are all-too-often mutually exclusive.	2011-08-08
We are uncomfortably reminded throughout the film that all living creatures have worth. Including man-made hybrids. Correction: especially man-made hybrids.	2011-08-07
Overly sentimental but warmhearted Marxist message pic.	2013-09-04
We are so held by the film's impact that its ending, surprise or not, is like a bonus.	2013-06-19
Kaurismaki returns with another of his deadpan comedies, reminiscent of the great silent comedians, though this one is arguably one of his gentlest as well.	2012-08-22
Le Havre is presented as an oasis of happy inclusiveness within a regimented, uniformed, legislated and suspicious world at large; to spend time here is a pleasure.	2012-04-16
Kaurismaki turns his affectionate, whimsical eye on the impoverished but generous folk of a run-down, waterfront community in the Normandy port of Le Havre.	2012-04-07
The result is both charming and purposeful.	2012-04-06
Written and directed by Finland's Aki Kaurismaki, this warmly engaging film is an understated pleasure about a surprisingly resourceful underdog.	2012-04-06
The intricately woven tale of hide and seek is full of priceless, poker-faced comedy and heartrending tenderness.	2012-04-06
No other director could maintain this degree of optimism while telling such a superficially grim story.	2012-04-05
It's a satisfying and distinctively lovable film.	2012-04-05
A charming feel-good fantasy of 'Marxist' solidarity resurgent against the chill of post-9/11 modernity.	2012-04-05
Kaurismaki clearly knows this is a fantasy, and it's a perfectly pleasant one at that.	2012-04-05
A gorgeous hymn to the struggles of the working man.	2012-04-05
I was on cloud nine throughout the film: that place of Technicolored rapture where Kaurismaki fans dwell, and where past, present and oneiric future are rolled celestially into one.	2012-04-04
Such a heart-warming tale in any other hands could so easily become schmaltzy (a Spielberg remake would be awful), but the deadpan delivery and endless idiosyncrasies counterbalance this tendency.	2012-04-04
Kaurismaki fashions a droll, engaging fairytale, with echoes of Casablanca in its colourful, close-knit Normandaise resistance...	2012-04-01
This is no doubt a message movie, but it delivers its message in an unforced, quirky way that leaves you feeling as though you've been pleasurably cajoled rather than harangued.	2012-03-29
A warm-hearted salute to both classical French cinema and working-class solidarity.	2012-03-26
Le Havre could be described as the ever-quirky Aki Kaurismaki's 'wish list' film addressing today's tide of refugees who are usually faceless crowds or worse, corpses at the unintended end of their journey	2012-03-24
There's something extremely pure about this simple yet beautiful film in which ordinary people do extraordinary things	2012-03-24
It is rare and welcome to watch a movie that automatically assumes people will do the right thing at the slightest provocation.	2012-03-16
Endearingly quirky, just this side of precious, but so warm and deftly executed that you go along with it.	2012-03-07
A humanist hug of a fable, which concludes that while big miracles may happen, it's the everyday 'miracles' people create for one another that really count.	2012-02-22
Uses Kaurismaki's dry wit to tell a tale that's more earnest and political than anything he's done, but which retains the skewed Scandinavian worldview we've come to expect.	2012-01-25
[It's] a movie that - like fellow 2011 Cannes entry The Kid With A Bike - is all about generosity of spirit and the cosmic rewards afforded those who live compassionately.	2012-01-17
A charming film that celebrates humanity.	2012-01-13
"Le Havre" is a passing fancy of a film, but it passes quite nicely indeed.	2012-01-13
o Kaurismaki potizei thn istoria toy me ton naif soyrealismo kai to idiotypo xioymor poy exeis mathei na perimeneis ap' tis tainies toy, enw thn idia wra se pairnei ap' to xeraki kai se taksideyei sthn istoria toy kinhmatografoy	2012-01-05
The latest work by Finnish cult director Aki Kaurismaki is is his strongst in a decade--and one of 2011 best foreign pictures.	2011-12-30
The movie never wears out its welcome with an efficient 93-minute running time. Besides the four principal characters, the supporting cast makes an impression playing a grocer, a baker, a tavern owner and Marcel's best buddy from Vietnam. It also...	2011-12-30
While the film never reaches any hugely profound revelations with its parable-styled stories of compassion and community, and occasionally feels a little slight, it's also enormously enjoyable and gorgeous to watch.	2011-12-14
It's a puzzle, and an intriguing one.	2011-12-08
In two stories of evolving trust and secrets, Le Havre reflects the essential simplicity of the moral choices made in its simple-seeming camera set-ups.	2011-12-07
'Tis the season, so the saying goes. And when it comes to Aki Kaurismaki, it holds true. The Finnish writer-director arrives bearing a gift wrapped in a contemporary immigration fable.	2011-12-02
Kaurismaki's movie about a shoeshine man and an illegal immigrant is nothing less than a joy	2011-12-01
A wonderfully concise, unfussy movie; it is "easy" by the director's standards, which is to say that it doesn't leave any significant ellipses in the narrative up until the aggressively darling ending.	2011-11-29
If the bummers and ambiguity of some of this season's movies are getting you down - or, hey, just the bummers and ambiguities of life - make your way to Le Havre. You won't be sorry.	2011-11-25
...an upbeat little tome that leaves a good feeling to the spirit.	2011-11-23
Kaurismaki can almost restore your hope in humanity.	2011-11-19
Kaurismaki dives into French film culture in 'Le Havre'	2011-11-11
The Finnish director's sense of humor is dry and dark as pitch, as he consistently finds moments of absurdity in the midst of strife and tragedy.	2011-11-10
You almost become a citizen of Le Havre, watching this film and rejoicing at the end as two newfound, unexpected friends share a drink.	2011-11-10
Kaurismaki wrote the script, I think, with secret credit from Mother Goose and some fabric softener.	2011-11-10
"Le Havre" is a small bit of movie magic, a story that plays more as a fable even as it deals with something as topical as immigration.	2011-11-10
It's a straightforward yet completely artificial scenario, with welcome overtones of Italian Neo-Realism.	2011-11-09
Unlike the director's typical hero, Wilms's spare performance conveys confidence rather than defeat. He and the kid warm the heart, thawing Kaurismaki's usual icy aplomb.	2011-11-08
Heart-wrenching but ultimately inspirational.	2011-11-04
Le Havre is not the filmmaker's best work (see La Vie de Boheme for that), but no matter the storm, we should be grateful to dock in this port.	2011-11-04
The film is especially comforting if you love old movies, as Kaurismaki does.	2011-11-03
Does Kaurismaki believe in his own fairy tale? The movie, a humble delight, suggests the answer is yes.	2011-11-03
Moneyball is a winner, one of the freshest and smartest sports movies in years.	2014-05-06
Directed by Capote's Bennett Miller, this is one helluva good sports movie. It's a terrific movie, period.	2014-05-06
Writer Aaron Sorkin works best at auctioneer speeds, and some of the best scenes involve Pitt's character working the phones, calling and stalling other teams' managers, trading players like a used-car salesman.	2014-05-06
This is a baseball story that's less about game-winning hits and more about people willing to challenge the establishment.	2014-05-06
Brad Pitt is at the top of his own game as Beane. Cocky and often nonchalant, he is gnawed by doubts that he tries to cover by grabbing a snack or pitching a grin.	2014-05-06
That such a literally spreadsheet-intensive story could register real human thought and feeling at all has to count as some kind of triumph.	2014-05-06
Moneyball is a great sports movie, yes, but it will also cross audiences. It's one of the year's finest.	2014-05-06
Moneyball looks like an underdog sports movie, but it veers away from the path usually followed by films of the genre. My suggestion is that you set aside any preconceptions and just go with the flow.	2014-05-06
Australia may not exactly be mad for the game, but I suspect - I hope - that the latest film from Bennett Miller (Capote) will inspire a few more people to become immersed in it.	2013-09-08
A well-written and incredibly smart film about baseball.	2013-06-30
The film tries to coast on its charm without asking much of its audience.	2013-06-22
Moneyball isn't just a great baseball movie; it's a great movie about baseball - and there's a difference.	2013-03-04
A thinking person's baseball movie.	2013-01-04
Great performances, exciting moments, and creative cinematography make Moneyball a home run for both baseball and movie fans.	2012-10-02
With its wonderful performances and well-written script, "Moneyball" is one of the better sports movies of recent years.	2012-09-19
Moneyball is more interesting than your typical sports drama thanks to the direction. Bennett Miller takes a rather grey, cement-enshrouded setting and gives it a little pizzazz.	2012-09-15
The end result mirrors the actual season Moneyball depicts, a memorable run but a loss in the final game played.	2012-08-31
A fine, strong, adult movie, and its theme can easily apply to any number of other walks of life.	2012-04-30
Even when delving deep into stats talk, one doesn't need to be at all interested in baseball, much less sports geek minutiae, to be hooked in.	2012-04-08
The process of winning	2012-03-02
The cast compliment the writing, with Pitt and Hill nailing every golden line they were handed.	2012-02-16
Moneyball is, in the end, undone by its excessively subdued atmosphere and pace...	2012-02-01
With razor sharp wit and delivery, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are sensational together, hitting Moneyball clean and out of the park.	2012-01-12
I enjoyed this film... with certain reservations.	2012-01-03
Two features into his directing career, Bennett Miller has managed to refresh not only the traditional biopic, but the inspirational sports drama as well.	2012-01-03
Jerry Maguire just got some overdue company with Moneyball, which features Pitt and Hill in perhaps their most likable roles.	2012-01-01
Keeps the economic talk in check and brings the human drama to the forefront.	2011-12-31
One of the ten best films of 2011.	2011-12-30
You don't need to know the first thing about OBP or OPS to get caught up in the drama. This is a classic underdog story that just happens to have baseball as its backdrop.	2011-12-28
full review at Movies for the Masses	2011-12-26
A highly detailed, fascinating slice of baseball history, 'Moneyball' will appeal to both sports aficionados and those (like yours truly) who are not. This is the true story of how a manager met the challenge of a small budget and beat the odds.	2011-12-22
While its compatriots focus on strength, Moneyball celebrates strategy, recounting the unlikely true story of how brains triumphed over brawn	2011-12-20
'Moneyball' Shows What You Can Tell.	2011-12-07
A wordy but well-paced and thrilling film, closer to co-writer Aaron Sorkin's The Social Network than previous baseball-themed big hitters Bull Durham or Field of Dreams.	2011-11-27
Fascinating, moving and very funny to boot, this will entertain both those who love the game and those who say: "It's just Rounders!" Brilliant.	2011-11-27
Consistently exciting and highly intelligent, as you might expect from a script by Steve Zaillian, who wrote Schindler's List, and Aaron Sorkin, who created The West Wing and won an Oscar for The Social Network.	2011-11-27
Pitt is terrific as the film's complex, driven protagonist, and he and a heavy-hitting supporting cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman's stubborn coach, take Aaron Sorkin's smart script and knock the ball right out of the park.	2011-11-25
I had been reduced to a slobbering gushy mess by the end of this gloriously entertaining movie even though I'd spend the entirety of the running time before this marveling at how this is the least sentimental baseball movie ever.	2011-11-25
Thanks to the strange kind of alchemy that makes films as joyously unpredictable as any evenly-balanced sporting fixture, putting Pitt in a baseball movie pays off with remarkable results.	2011-11-25
It's an engaging, almost exotic film.	2011-11-25
Brad Pitt in a dugout. Oh dear; oh dear. Here is baseball, reel upon reel and inning upon inning.	2011-11-25
What we're left with is a sporadically entertaining mess. Moneyball is unsure about what (if any) risks it should take.	2011-11-25
The mark of a truly great sports movie is one that appeals to people who don't like sports.	2011-11-25
An accomplished, bracingly intelligent film that scores points on all fronts...	2011-11-24
It's the best film about statistics you're ever likely to see.	2011-11-24
Impressively directed and sharply written, this is a hugely enjoyable, largely cliche-resistant sports drama with great performances from Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.	2011-11-24
A topical corporate shakedown story that anyone can relate to in this day and age, and it's all down to the Pitt-Hill chemistry that keeps you engaged.	2011-11-23
Even if you're not at all familiar with the story, this was bound to happen, as they were hardly going to make a film about a losing team.	2011-11-23
While making no effort to explain the terminology - mathematical or baseball-ical - the script throws enough fastballs to keep even the most ignorant of us Limeys entertained.	2011-11-23
As an example of smarter-than-average Hollywood fare - and a sly dig at modern sporting politics - 'Moneyball' has all the key bases covered.	2011-11-22
A must see for Fishbone fans.	2012-03-09
It's a hearty, thoughtful, smartly assembled, vaguely complete documentary about a rock band that, even by the standards of out-there musical acts, seemed out there both in the mid-1980s and even now.	2012-01-10
It's a movie about what it's like to almost make it in the music business, but not really, not quite. It's about coming close and watching it slip away.	2012-01-05
To hear the soaring craziness of Fishbone's "Sunless Saturday" is to wonder how such musical inspiration could possibly miss.	2011-12-16
It's a much more interesting story than your usual Behind the Music arc.	2011-12-16
What makes this better than the usual Behind the Music-style doc is the frankness of its subjects and the fun way the filmmakers intersperse Fat Albert-style animation to tell their story.	2011-12-16
Even as a hagiography, though, it's pretty interesting.	2011-12-16
Anderson and Metzler collect dozens of great bits of rehearsal and performance footage as well as intimate footage between Moore and his family.	2011-12-02
"Everyday Sunshine" presents a raw lesson in how artistry and success often make incompatible partners.	2011-12-01
Everyday Sunshine is an uplifting entry that rises to its task rather than letting the music do all the talking.	2011-11-22
[It] isn't the happiest movie about a band you'll ever see, but it is one of the more entertaining, and thanks to directors Lev Anderson and Christ Metzler, one of the most original.	2011-11-17
The pinnacle comes when Kendall rejoins them for an impromptu gig, stirring hope for a return to glory.	2011-11-15
Hold on to your hats for a heartwarming look into the private lives and public outrage of Fishbone, the critical mass that refuses to melt down.	2011-10-31
Gets the job done, and admirably, blending interviews, testimonials, concert footage and, interestingly, animation to build a full and engaging portrait of Fishbone.	2011-10-28
It seems telling just how many other musicians were willing to participate in the documentary to attest to the outfit's influence.	2011-10-21
Everyday Sunshine doesn't do the band the disservice of falling at their feet in worship, like too many recent films about legendary musicians	2011-10-20
The fun and energy of those performances show the promise that was lost - and the pleasure that's still in the music.	2011-10-20
Terrific, deeply affecting rock documentary that captures the unlikely assemblage of a bunch of L.A. black guys playing the kind of music no one had ever really heard before.	2011-10-10
It all comes together for a rollicking chronicle of verve and nerve.	2011-10-07
Seizes that tumultuous spirit, that sheer history of Fishbone, rolling it into a tremendous, informative documentary that avoids tracking footprints, instead exposing the raw nerve sensitivity within this legendary band.	2011-10-07
Sharp, insightful look at the ups and downs of one of L.A.'s most influential alternative bands.	2011-10-07
The group's influence - attested to by members of No Doubt, the Peppers and Jane's Addiction, among many others - is indisputable.	2011-10-06
Directors Chris Metzler and Lev Anderson seem to have considered several different approaches for their film and settled on all of them.	2011-10-06
A truly wonderful experience.	2011-10-06
Anderson and Metzler have assembled a formidable lineup of highly articulate talking heads to make the case for Fishbone's significance.	2011-10-05
Filled with personal vignettes and famous-people testimonials, the film has a few too many narrative digressions, but it's a moving portrait of all-too-human personalities and the dogged optimism that keeps them going.	2011-10-05
Effortlessly entertaining.	2011-10-05
Its vibrant, unusual form is a function of its multiple approaches. While it includes interviews, family photos, and footage of the band's electrifying performances, it also features animated sequences and competing accounts of particular events.	2011-10-05
Persistence for Fishbone hasn't (yet) resulted in something you'd call a happy ending. Yet maybe that's preferable. It means they're still playing, still writing, and they aren't ready to quit.	2011-10-05
Everyday Sunshine pours in beams from the screen in what should be a fun experience for both fans and non-fans.	2011-10-05
There's just enough uncut truth and soul in Fishbone's story to keep die-hard Boneheads skankin' to the beat, even if it's just for nostalgia's sake.	2011-10-05
Packed with fantastic performance footage, it solidly makes the case that, throughout the '80s and early '90s, Fishbone was one of rock's best live acts ever -- furiously energetic, innovative, leaping multiple genres in a single song.	2011-10-04
Dynamic elements lend the film an intoxicating, electric vibe that sets it apart from most "behind the scenes" documentaries.	2011-10-04
Many bands have a might-have-been story, but few have a story that reflects such rich and paradoxical ideas.	2011-10-03
Like their subjects, the directors themselves have attempted an all-over-the-place style--and surprisingly succeeded.	2011-10-02
Some fascinating music history and watching Angelo's amazing antics add up to a very engaging audience experience.	2011-10-01
The music will not appeal to all, but the documentary moves and covers the material.	2011-09-30
Desperately seeking the key of we	2011-09-08
A wonderful celebration of Fishbone's spirit. It's one of the best rock docs I've ever seen.	2011-09-07
Those of us lucky enough to have seen the punk, funk and ska band in a sweaty nightclub might have borrowed a different title: "Party at Ground Zero."	2011-08-26
It's not just the story of Fishbone--it's the story of creating art, living with oneself, living with others, and moving on with things.	2011-08-17
Aspires to be more than an episode of Behind the Music and succeeds largely due to the amazing talent of the band it chronicles, the stunning, one-and-only Fishbone.	2011-04-14
Makes a convincing case for Fishbone as underrecognized pioneers of a multicultural mash-up esthetic...	2011-04-08
	2012-02-22
We Were Here ultimately serves as a tribute -- not only to those who are no longer with us, but also to those who crossed the minefield and emerged as survivors, storytellers and heroes.	2012-03-30
...cinematographer Marsha Kahm has done a stellar job of zeroing in on the disparate visages whether revelling in the joy of a long-forgotten moment with a former partner or letting tears of 'Why not me?' come into unabashed focus.	2012-03-02
A simple, powerful act of bearing witness, We Were Here is a sober reminder of the not-too-distant past, when gays were focused not on honeymoon plans but on keeping people alive.	2012-02-28
...simple yet very intense, and if you have any interest in gay history, you won't want to miss it.	2012-01-22
Cathartic and bittersweet with moments of joy and humor. Weissman's movie is a rare gift.	2012-01-13
an insular story, told by insiders, of a particular community - a community to which this reviewer happened to be connected ... invaluable as a reminder of how it felt to be helpless, to be thought lost, and yet prevail. They - we - did overcome.	2011-12-17
...this is a work that chronicles the very beginnings of a disease that shook the world for decades.	2011-12-07
...honors the fallen, the survivors and those who helped both by documenting the intensity and the many issues surrounding the maelstrom which was the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco	2011-12-06
[It's] as much about survival as tragedy, and any statistics in it pale in comparison to the personal testimony of those telling the tale.	2011-11-30
Maintaining the perfect balance between the political and the personal, this is a documentary that will make you feel as well as think.	2011-11-29

The filmmakers have amassed an amazing archive of photos and videotapes, but it is the intimate, personal testimonies that make the film so vital, urgent, and necessary.	2011-10-09

In these days of epidemiological awareness, we know there'll be a next time, with different details. Amid its pathos, We Were Here is a cautionary tale for when that time arrives.	2011-09-30

Reminds us that sometimes people really do pull together and help each other...	2011-09-12
Despite the development of life-preserving drugs, the AIDS epidemic is sadly still very much in the world. This trenchant documentary reminds us of its roots in a terrifying time which was nonetheless marked by a singular, beautiful humanity.	2011-09-09
Director David Weissman does everything you're generally not supposed to do in a documentary - we get talking heads, old news footage, and still photographs, and that's about it - but We Were Here is never less than riveting.	2011-09-08
An extraordinarily moving, beautifully edited documentary...	2011-09-08
We Were Here utilizes an invaluable archive of period pictures and news footage to trace how the Castro went from Edenic neighborhood to an epidemic frontline.	2011-09-07
A simple, powerful act of bearing witness, We Were Here is a sober reminder of the not-too-distant past, when gays were focused not on honeymoon plans but on keeping people alive.	2011-09-06
A harrowing oral history of the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco whose spine is the freshly recounted horror of an "avalanche" of grief.	2011-09-05
A riveting reflection on the initial, devastating impact of the AIDS epidemic on San Francisco's gay community. Don't watch it without a box of tissues handy.	2011-07-22
Almost overwhelming in its emotional kick, this documentary about the San Francisco Aids epidemic is so intensely personal that it's sometimes difficult to watch. Which is why it's so important.	2011-04-07
... the document of record, establishing the public, collective memory of a time and place so many have wanted to forget.	2011-03-01
There is no turning away from the screen.	2011-02-24

We Were Here documents the epidemic through a powerful combination of first-hand testimony, archival photography and TV news footage.	2011-01-28
	2011-11-25
The movie is so quiet that everything starts to feel heightened; the smallest motions carry great weight, and something as minor as a slammed door causes you to gasp.	2013-07-02
A complicated unflinching look at a boy struggling to thrive in a harsh world.	2013-06-30
The directing by the Dardenne brothers reflects their previous work: it wants to be unnoticed either for virtuosity or clumsiness, yet only virtuosos can attain this ideal.	2013-06-18
The images speed by so fast that you hardly have time to think. But think you do. And what you think about most are all the lost and neglected children of the world.	2013-06-02
French Loach.	2013-03-24
The Dardennes have once again crafted a lean, efficient film that is plotted with singular purpose without hitting a false note.	2013-03-11
Downbeat but powerful drama about childhood and love.	2013-02-06
It's nonetheless immensely satisfying - not least in its commitment to a child protagonist whose near-feral intensity and unthinking ingratitude make him the polar opposite of cute.	2013-01-08
There is not a wasted shot in this stripped down, pared back fable. Yet, it accrues a deep and lasting power. You won't see many better this year.	2013-01-07
It's a powerful, well-crafted film and a striking depiction of a side of growing up few filmmakers have tried to put on film. Fewer still have captured it with this sort of honesty and emotional gravity.	2013-01-07
[Thrusts] adults into the psychology of a child, pushing them into a confrontation with their own self-involvement.	2012-08-22
The Dardennes smoothly shift one gear up in the film's coda, offering a sting of humility before a flash of quiet grace. Then we're left watching after one boy on his bike, stubbornly moving, moving, moving, a force to be reckoned with and respected.	2012-07-24
A frank, no-nonsense drama filled with compassion for a lost soul kid abandoned by his father.	2012-05-14
...a deeply humane movie that deserves to be compared with one of its obvious inspirations, Vittorio De Sica's neo-realist classic Bicycle Thieves	2012-05-12
A moving, sweet and at times harrowing tale...	2012-05-10
De France does a terrific job of balancing maternal instinct with matter-of-factness, in a performance that is more human than tender - and all the more powerful for it.	2012-05-10
Unlike many films, it genuinely earns every feeling it evokes.	2012-05-09
a complex interweaving of bitter reality and a deeply humane worldview that sees the possibility of redemption in even the cruelest of circumstances	2012-05-01
A beautiful and stirring story of unconditional compassion, of emotional honesty, and -- above all -- of hope.	2012-04-27
The Dardennes' style resists cheap sentimentality, yet in The Kid with a Bike it yields a deeply moving examination of love as a shield.	2012-04-22
Dardenne brothers set an orphan in search of a father	2012-04-15
Will bad breaks break a boy?	2012-04-15
The film should be required viewing for everyone who has lost faith in the power of random acts of kindness.	2012-04-13
How the Dardennes, time and again, turn gritty, mundane subjects into transcendent moments of honesty and truth is one of the great cinematic wonders.	2012-04-13
This is a film that's not always easy to watch, but just about impossible to forget.	2012-04-13
It is crystal clear on at least one point: People are mysterious and beautiful, and they need each other.	2012-04-12
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne offer another in their remarkable succession of contemporary neo-realist dramas in this quietly devastating but gently hopeful [film].	2012-04-07
[It] gives obvious homage to a variety of films. ... But one inspiration shines throughout the movie ... The Red Balloon.	2012-04-02
...the film delivers a final act as riveting as it is artistically satisfying. Not many films can claim a perfect ending. This one can.	2012-03-30
...manages to balance a spiritual sense of grace with the earthy eye of a here-and-now realist.	2012-03-30
"The Kid With a Bike" vibrates with desperation, frustration and the simple unfairness of life, leavened with glimpses of hope.	2012-03-30
Cyril is one of the most inspiringly resilient, self-aware young characters to arrive on-screen in recent memory...	2012-03-30
Hunched over the handlebars, the boy's body seems to carve a hole in the wind. And we watch as this unhappy, rejected child makes some terrible choices, some of which make us want to look away.	2012-03-29
One of the classic international works about juvenile delinquency.	2012-03-29
"The Kid With A Bike'' is, remarkably, about hope - about the connections people forge when the ones they've been given desert them.	2012-03-29
If the film doesn't sizzle as heatedly as the Dardennes' more celebrated works, it's nevertheless infused with the compassion and care that they seem always to bring to bear on any subject.	2012-03-29
This film is a real gem.	2012-03-28
Emotionally restrained yet compassionate, coming-of-age morality tale	2012-03-27
The ending is somewhat contrived and forced, but not false, and there's a moving moment when Cyril and Samantha, riding beside a canal one sunny day, exchange bicycles.	2012-03-25
[The Dardennes'] latest threads back to previous works in intriguing and satisfying ways...	2012-03-24
To their credit, the Dardennes portray their subjects with a minimum of sentimentality.	2012-03-24
It seems like a fairly minor movie, although one with major emotional pull.	2012-03-23
Remains an effective picture with a genuine feel for human behavior, unearthing a direct sense of disturbance and a few select moments of stunning psychological clarity.	2012-03-23
The Dardennes' quiet, naturalistic style strips this story of melodrama but not of emotion.	2012-03-23
A film of rosy optimism it features a beguiling performance from screen newcomer doret who achieves a wonderfully natural, touching chemistry with de France.	2012-03-22
Beyond Samantha's hard-to-fathom loyalty, many of the plot twists are predictable and contrived.	2012-03-22
You wouldn't exactly call The Kid With a Bike a feel-good movie, but by the end it certainly invites the viewer to be hopeful about human nature. Another gem from the boys.	2012-03-22
Without diminishing the boy's intensity or making him in any way ingratiating, the Dardennes take us into his mind, and we begin to appreciate not only his predicament but his resiliency.	2012-03-22
Dardenne heroes are crafty and restless, down but not out, and Cyril ought to be one of their best. For whatever reason, he isn't, quite.	2012-03-22
Compassionate, humane but never sentimental.	2012-03-22
What it had going for it was an uncanny and moving relationship between Gosling and Mulligan.	2013-06-24
This is pop art of the highest degree.	2013-06-22
Hands down the coolest film of 2011, Drive is a stylised genre film where the genre is constantly changing.	2013-03-04
Something under the hood of Drive captured my heart; director Nicolas Winding Refn has admirably crafted a fine piece of retro-noir cinema.	2012-10-02
Neither overblown action movie or intimate character study, Drive is somewhere in between - my approximation of "an arthouse Fast & Furious" wasn't too wide of the mark after all.	2012-09-28
Nicolas Winding Refn's atmosperic direction, Gosling's sheer presence and a soundtrack that's perfection make Drive a fantastic film.	2012-09-15
With a titanic infusion of pound-feet of torque, Drive is the best movie of 2011, a raging race that's part F1 and equal part demolition derby.	2012-08-24
If Sofia Coppola were a dude making genre action movies to impress Quentin Tarantino ... those movies would be a lot like this.	2012-06-15
Drive is surprising in many ways, from its quietly spoken first act through its increasingly violent and unexpected trajectory.	2012-03-14
It's a slow-burn romantic fairy tale that suddenly turns dark and very violent, but director Nicholas Winding Refn is a master at developing suspense and menace, and every frame of this movie is dripping with both.	2012-02-11
A classic tale of revenge, love and madness is given a refreshing polish and shine by director Nicolas Winding Refn. Drive is one of the year's very best.	2012-02-01
Nicholas Winding Refn's 'neon-noir' heist film Drive winds the speedo back 25 years to honour the spirit of 80s action films, but this fable about fast cars and mob violence isn't afraid to show its feminine side.	2012-01-31
... celebrates -- one might say revels in -- the pulp mythology of existential anti-heroes and criminal chivalry and street opera tragedy of American movies.	2012-01-31
Delivers the thrilling action goods with craft and distinctive style.	2012-01-26
Young directors would do well to take a cue or two from Refn when it comes to telling an engrossing story, because when a filmmaker with real vision is at the wheel, even the familiar can feel fresh, new, and exciting.	2012-01-04
The real star of this film is the direction of cult Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, making his Hollywood debut.	2012-01-03
"Drive" is not the "Fast and Furious" knockoff you might think it is based on the advertising. It is far more artistic and thoughtful than any of those films could ever hope to be. Consider it a thinking man's action movie.	2011-12-28
Action and smarts don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. But director Nicolas Winding Refn ('Bronson') deftly blends them in 'Drive,' a phenomenally entertaining movie that employs a haunting soundtrack, clever direction and entertaining characters.	2011-12-22
A firecracker up the backside of the bloated modern action movie...	2011-12-07
Drive's most striking movie reference might be the one where you're watching Irene watch the Driver enact an especially awful beat-down. It's a moment that's at once frightening, tragic, and not startling enough.	2011-12-07
It's a film that has its finger on the pulse of what's current and in style, and one that has solidified its place as the coolest film of the year.	2011-11-15
That rare film that can shock both with its uncommonly cool style and chillingly raw substance.	2011-11-08
This isn't a movie about action, it's a movie about fate, coincidence, and penance before the clock runs out.	2011-11-07
A deliberately paced hybrid of high and low art, one that burns ice-cold with meticulous steadicam shots and hypnotic slow-motion, effortless coolness and stylish intelligence.	2011-11-01
Drive works if you succumb to its broad brush strokes of emotion, the plot propelled by vague ambition and greed, the lush cinematography and the dreamy 80s inspired synthesiser soundtrack.	2011-10-28
One of this year's most original, entertaining and frankly shocking American movies.	2011-10-26
What Drive is trying to do is very clear, but clear intent doesn't forgive a film that's mostly flat.	2011-10-26
The film then, with its elegant style evoking an eighties neon-drenched aesthetic, succeeds effortlessly at blending striking ultra-violence with the screenplays more ponderous sequences of blossoming romance.	2011-10-26
If you can make it through one viewing, I dare say Drive is a film you're going to want to watch again and again.	2011-10-26
Ultra-violent, ultra-tedious, bargain-basement rip-off of the classic 1978 Walter Hill film The Driver.	2011-10-25
Drive, above all else, reminds us why Gosling has been hailed as the new Sean Penn, or even a 21st-century Brando. He is outstanding.	2011-10-23
It is ironic how much filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn uses the brakes in pacing this noirish art house thriller	2011-10-22
A gripping heist thriller with a difference, Drive relies on subtleties, surprises and shocks as it keeps the audience engrossed	2011-10-22
A laboratory distillation, but a fairly ravishing one	2011-10-16
While you could lean back and nod along to Refn's posturing, the film plays more like an exercise in turn-of-the-Eighties nostalgia, a movie-length strong-silent swagger inspired by the art on a VHS box.	2011-10-09
That rarity of rarities, an arty actioner that requires almost no excuses.	2011-10-06
Refn's style is to draw out scenes to make a slow film punctuated with strong violence.	2011-10-06
The film treats the audience with intelligence; it doesn't lay everything out and instead leaves you to do a little legwork too.	2011-10-05
Terrific, pulpy stuff.	2011-10-05
...the film's irresistibly stylish atmosphere [compensates] for its general lack of context and substance.	2011-09-30
Punctuates its long stretches of cool, carefully calculated menace with splattery spasms of shocking violence.	2011-09-29
full review at Movies for the Masses	2011-09-29
A more or less conventional Los Angeles-set hot-rod/getaway-driver movie with neo-noir decoration -- albeit satisfying enough on its own terms.	2011-09-27
One for fans of Taxi Driver and TV's Dexter, Drive is a film whose considerable style at first obscures just how much it'll get under your skin and stay there for weeks to come.	2011-09-26
From its opening shots, Refn's movie is as cool and controlled as its protagonist... at once unhurriedly stylish and intensely gripping. You'd like to lean back and admire, but the action keeps pulling you to the edge of your seat.	2011-09-26
High-octane excitement for the art-house set ... Think 'Two-Lane Blacktop' meets Kubrick's 'The Killing' meets Bresson ... Gosling's King of Cool may be the new McQueen.	2011-09-25
Like the novels of Raymond Chandler and the paintings of David Hockney, Drive is both an accurate view of southern California's intoxicating sleaze and glamour and the filtering of it through a European sensibility.	2011-09-25
A film that moves relentlessly forward, carrying you along so completely that it's only afterwards, if at all, that you begin to wonder about origins and plausibilities.	2011-09-25
In proving that less is more, Rifn has sent out a message to Hollywood in this age of austerity.	2011-09-23
Like watching rats fight in a gorgeously lit bucket, this is compellingly nasty, but for those with stomach for it, Drive is a lot of fun.	2011-09-23
"Hugo" is a magical cinematic experience, and a masterpiece so unlike anything Scorsese has made before. Captivating and original, it is the director's most human film yet.	2013-09-25
Henceforth when people speak of movie magic they will think instantly of Martin Scorsese's mind-blowing 'Hugo.'	2013-05-26
Scorsese's moving and magical tribute to the pioneers of filmmaking.	2013-03-04
A children's film for grownups - grownup film buffs.	2012-12-28
A luminous triumph that may just remind you why our hearts leap when the lights go down in a movie theater.	2012-10-22
Scorsese is a master storyteller and one of the best directors working today. He doesn't need a gimmick like 3-D to prove this. His films speak more than enough for themselves and "Hugo" is no exception.	2012-09-18
It's an ode to cinema; it's everything that modern cinematic audiences take for granted. This film is Scorsese's gift to an audience that isn't old enough to have ever heard his name.	2012-05-08
If you've become a little cynical about going to movies due to inflated ticket prices, Michael Bay films and chatty audiences, Hugo may restore your faith in the wonder of cinema.	2012-03-08
a paean to the birth and continual rebirth of movie magic	2012-02-28
One of the year's very best, Hugo is a rousing, moving, poignant tale being told on many more levels than what is seen on screen.	2012-02-27
...not only pays tribute to the splendors of filmmaking by talking about them but by demonstrating them. It's a picture for film lovers of all ages.	2012-02-26
the most soulful, most personal fiction film in [Scorsese's] career	2012-02-24
Hugo is far too charming, welcoming and beautiful to look at to be dismissed as one of those films that critics adore but audiences ignore.	2012-02-23
Uma obra com dupla personalidade que inspira sentimentos conflitantes: e facil admira-la intelectualmente, mas dificil abraca-la emocionalmente.	2012-02-17

La imaginacion y la perfecta ejecucion cinematografica de Martin Scorsese y su equipo de maestros colaboradores son la llave y la puerta de entrada a este calido homenaje al arte cinematografico.	2012-02-15
On some very basic levels, Hugo just isn't very good.	2012-02-03
This movie is magic and it honors all those magicians like Martin Scorcese who make dreams we can all share.	2012-02-02
Scorsese's unlikely 3D family film takes an agreeably pragmatic stance, that we must embrace the past yet never deny progress.	2012-01-25
A movie that needs to be appreciated for its finer aspects and deeper meaning if it is to be appreciated properly, which is noble enough but could feel exclusive to some.	2012-01-13
Never mind that the tone wavers and the pace is mostly plodding, the film champions all the right things and the beautifully crafted images (in 3D glory) leave a lasting impression	2012-01-12
There are many lovely things in this film it is easy to forgive its small shortcomings	2012-01-12
Martin Scorsese takes a left turn into family film territory in Hugo and delivers a movie that celebrates the wonders which the imagination can conjure.	2012-01-12
An exuberant and meticulous 3D spectacle by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.	2012-01-12
Scorsese, now in the winter of his career, has tapped into his own childlike passion for film with this late-period masterpiece.	2012-01-12
It's not an adventure, but a loving tribute to all the broken things, and those who would fix them.	2012-01-12
You can practically feel time stop in sync with the audience's halted breath. It's nothing short of wizardry.	2012-01-11
Who knew? The director who put the rage in Raging Bull the fear in Cape Fear and the mean in Mean Streets could make a family-friendly, dazzling 3D film.	2012-01-09
In Hugo Scorsese not only tells an important story about early cinema, but delivers a film that is a passionate and convincing reminder of the essential role art and imagination should play in our lives.	2012-01-08
Scorsese's exuberant, magical odyssey transports audiences to the dawn of cinema.	2012-01-07
The energy that's behind all of [Scorsese's] films is definitely present here.	2012-01-03
[Hugo is] movie that will probably appeal more to hardcore film nerds than to nine-year-olds, unless of course that youngster will grow into a movie geek. If that's the case, Hugo will be a touchstone in their cinematic development.	2012-01-03
Being a hardcore cinephile (like Scorsese) might add a layer of enjoyment, but it certainly isn't a prerequisite for walking in the door. A sense of wonder, however, is.	2012-01-03
Kingsley, who is surely this generations Robert Duvall (the man NEVER gives a bad performance) makes the character of Papa George come to life.	2012-01-01
One of the ten best films of 2011.	2011-12-30
As $150million public service announcements about the importance of the film preservation movement go, this is one of the best.	2011-12-23
A monument to wonder and excitement for all those still in knee socks or short trousers.	2011-12-22
Behind the horrible marketing lies a brilliant movie.	2011-12-18
A lovely, lavishly constructed dreamscape of long-ago movie magic, told with a spectacular flourish of modern-day movie magic all its own.	2011-12-16
Beautifully filmed in 3D it, turns into an education for the viewer on a subject near and dear to director Martin Scorsese's heart.	2011-12-15
Both a joyful and enchanting adventure tale and a loving tribute to the early days of cinema and one of its neglected pioneers.	2011-12-13
Scorsese has pulled out all the stops - and keeps yanking.	2011-12-12
Unlike any of the other Scorsese films.	2011-12-11
Hugo is an intensely personal statement from Scorsese, one not just about magic, but also the magic of cinema.	2011-12-09
An utterly beautiful film -- both visually and emotionally -- and itself an enchanting gift from Scorsese to film fans everywhere.	2011-12-09
Hugo may not be entirely successful as a children's film, but as the culmination of a lifetime love of the pure magic of film, this movie is a gift to be treasured and revisited.	2011-12-08
Hugo (3D) is a sumptuously crafted film that underlies Scorsese's aims of touching hearts, taking us to other places and providing us with striking visual memories.	2011-12-08
...too long, but a sweet story with excellent acting.	2011-12-08
As much as Hugo is being touted as Scorsese's foray into 3D, Melies' images, flat, awkward, and strangely beautiful, are its most memorable.	2011-12-07
Wow. This is now my favorite film of 2011. It is beautiful to look at and a great nod to the nostalgia of cinema from a true master.	2011-12-05
Boasting an exotic trip around the world, an engaging script, funny dialogue and spectacular stunts, "Ghost Protocol" is an adrenaline-rush adventure on a grand scale.	2013-09-25
Finally an action movie that recaptures the fun and adventure of old.	2013-03-04
Brad Bird takes the series up a notch with enjoyable character dynamics and a straightforward but still intriguing story featuring plenty of unique action set pieces.	2012-10-02
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is the kind of lean, mean, fearless action movie that chugs along at such a high tempo, you realise when leaving the cinema that you're actually running.	2012-09-28
"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol" is the best film in the series since the original. It's a fast-paced thrillride that'll keep you thoroughly engaged as it hops from one amazing sequence to the next.	2012-09-18
Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol may be nothing ground-breaking but it is the best example of how to make a skillfully made action film that works because of all the right elements that are blended together to create pure adrenaline bliss.	2012-09-17
Action films tend to get repetitive, especially sequels. It's refreshing to find an excellent, original and engaging one.	2012-09-15
It leaves X-Men: First Class, Captain America, and the rest of 2011&#8242;s glorified Saturday morning cartoons in its dust. I want to take this ride again.	2012-06-15
The action scenes more than make it worth watching, preferably in IMAX to really take in that spectacular skyscraper scene in its full glory.	2012-05-22
All the gizmos and technology on display in M:I 4 are probably impossible based on current science. But, wow, do you ever get the feeling that this neat stuff is very doable at some point in the future? I sure do.	2012-05-16
Pixar vet Brad Bird directs the best Mission: Impossible yet. See it on the biggest screen possible for maximum impact.	2012-05-16
...an opening prison escape appears to be modeled after a Busby Berkeley musical number, of all things.	2012-05-08
A smoothly rhythmed piece of work, moving at a pace sufficient to bypass inconvenient questions.	2012-04-30
It's Cruise's daredevil bravado that provides the film's standout episode, a sequence of hair-raising, palm-dampening, gob-smacking suspense that sees him clinging to the side of the world's tallest building.	2012-04-30
While the script occasionally flirts with weightlessness, Bird's ecstatic camera and some brilliant casting - to say nothing of Cruise's selflessness as a stuntman - make this a tentpole sequel worth getting behind.	2012-04-20
A knockout, tense action picture that proves there's plenty more life left in the Mission: Impossible franchise.	2012-04-01
...one of the best action adventures of the year if you're willing to suspend your disbelief for most of the picture.	2012-03-30
Brad Bird passes his audition for a career as a live-action director. And Ghost Protocol more than makes its bones as an argument for why Tom Cruise should continue in this role as long as his knees, and his nerves, hold up.	2012-03-23
Brad Bird's Mission made me feel like a kid again.	2012-02-03
... a good-size barrel of fun.	2012-01-20
still does not have the hang of what made the TV show so good.	2012-01-14
Cruises on the WOW! factor.	2012-01-09
Snagging Oscar-winning animation director Brad Bird to fill the director's chair proves to be an inspired choice--and, upon thought, a bit of a no-brainer.	2012-01-08
The screenplay doesn't rely too much on gimmicks to advance the plot. Instead, the plot is also character-driven to an extent. There are interesting dynamics going on in the Mission Impossible team.	2012-01-07
Director Brad Bird juices and gooses the whole affair with edge and excitement, new energy, humor and heartbeat, and a terrific feel for big, bold, audaciously daring sequences that beg for the biggest screen available.	2012-01-05
Great stunts and not a dull moment,	2012-01-04
Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol could very well be the series' best installment.	2012-01-03
It has a few very good ideas, and then, the rest of it is totally lackluster.	2012-01-03
Watching Tom leap from a hospital window on to a passing truck, I couldn't help but worry: Tom, those knees won't last forever.	2012-01-03
Succeeds in dishing up exactly what you would expect: State of the arts stunts, non-stop action, and a series of clearly laid-out heists and chases that go awry in all kinds of creative ways.	2012-01-01
Bird manages the escalations from the preposterous through the more preposterous to the most preposterous with skill and wit...	2012-01-01
...great cinematic entertainment.	2011-12-30
Better than the tower climb is the scene in which Hunt infiltrates the Kremlin with, essentially, a high-tech magic trick; the playfulness of the effect demonstrates the usefulness of Bird's background in the astonish-the-audience culture of animation.	2011-12-30
"Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol" is sheer hurtling mechanism-and it's great silly fun.	2011-12-30
So exciting you have to remind yourself to breathe.	2011-12-29
Ghost pulls off the impossible.	2011-12-28
Film number four has found its optimum screen display, its best director for the job and its sense of humour while increasing the gadgets and death-defying stunts.	2011-12-28
Something goes wrong and the entire Kremlin blows up. 'The wattage of my smile has overpowered the antiquated Russian electrical grid,' explained Tom.	2011-12-27
The cinematography is rewarding enough for a travelogue. The good guy vs. the world with a hateful bad guy is involving. This is another film where you should just leave your brain at home, relax, and enjoy it.	2011-12-26
Welcome to the post-Pixar action movie.	2011-12-26
Best line of 2011 delivered by Jeremy Renner: "That's it. Next time I get to seduce the rich guy." Why is MI4 so terrific? I screamed out in the theater: "The pants are gonna rip!"	2011-12-26
o Bird energa daneisthke kai merikes selides apo to skhnothetiko biblio toy Nolan, me pio ofthalmofanh kai dhlwmenh, th pisth pws to IMAX, kai oxi to S3D, mporei na epanaferei ayth thn apostomwtikh kallitexnikh flasia	2011-12-26
It's actually pretty entertaining... but a certain genericness is creeping in.	2011-12-24
A mature Tom Cruise is in top form here, displaying a relatively-sophisticated savoir faire in lieu of the easy boyish charm that's served him so well in the past.	2011-12-24
It's a great mix that feeds an action junkie's need for death defying stunts but reminds us how dangerous it all really is so that we remain engaged in the tension of the scene.	2011-12-24
Exhilarating, nerve-wracking, vertigo-inducing, action-packed popcorn picture, filled with spectacular feats of derring-do.	2011-12-24
This is some Star Trek level techno-nonsense, but the locations, stunts, and ambient batsh*ttedness of the entire endeavor provide ample distraction.	2011-12-24
Could be the poster boy for disposable films.	2011-12-24
By turns eye-watering, knee trembling, heart-pounding and rib-tickling, this gravity-defying blockbuster is what popcorn was invented for. Chomp away!	2011-12-23
...a perfectly watchable (yet undeniably overlong) entry in an almost remarkably consistent series...	2011-12-23
Ultimately, Source Code makes good on its Hitchcockian opening sequence -- it may pale in comparison to the master, but it's a fun, puzzle-filled ride, with excellent pacing and a mounting uneasiness that recalls the best episodes of The Twilight Zone.	2014-03-23
Source Code is a sci-fi thriller that simply shouldn't work as well as it does.	2014-03-23
It's this emotional arc underlying the ticking-time-bomb plot that keeps the movie from succumbing to its flaws.	2014-03-23
Source Code is a mind-bending minor classic of its type, a sort of Groundhog Day with terrorism and fewer weather reports. It's as if The Matrix hopped aboard a rapid-transit line and got derailed into the American military bureaucracy.	2014-03-23
Source Code takes off with some intense performances and an inventive story that pulls you in and makes you work for the payoff.	2014-03-23
A thoroughly original, imaginative and fast-flying tale in which the Groundhog Day aspects are secondary to a story of service, honor and dedication.	2014-03-23
Jones proves with Source Code that he understands how to pace a traditional thriller, and Gyllenhaal's display of comedic chops, confident bravado and tender sympathies prove that the 30-year-old actor has arrived at leading-man status.	2014-03-23
Jones ... has a light touch of the sort that enlivens the material without trivializing it-think of it as tongue delicately navigating the perimeter of cheek	2013-06-20
Fantastic pacing, an excellent performance by Gyllenhaal and smart storytelling make this a wonderful film.	2013-05-03
Adorably preposterous	2013-01-10
In spite of an over-complicated premise, Source Code succeeds in offering an above-average thriller -- with interesting sci-fi ideas for genre buffs to debate.	2012-10-02
More like a thinking man's Speed as opposed to a what-were-you-thinking man's Deja Vu.	2012-09-27
"Source Code" is a fascinating sci-fi action film that works surprisingly well given the scant logic it gets away with.	2012-09-21
Duncan Jones continues to build a rep for heady and ambitious sci-fi.	2012-04-08
Holes in logic get swept aside by the brisk pace and stimulating tale.	2012-01-03
Jones' conception of how the universe works pretty much eliminates the possibility of drama.	2012-01-03
Were it supremely confident of knowing when to show its trump card, the film could have gone even further.	2011-12-18
Source Code is genuinely compelling and - whilst not always successful - remains a fine example of an intelligent, modern sci-fi thriller.	2011-11-19
Uma ficcao cientifica exemplar: apresenta um conceito interessante, explora-o a fundo e, de quebra, nos apresenta a questoes de fundo filosofico-existencial enquanto cria personagens complexos e tocantes.	2011-09-30
This intelligent sci-fi-thriller is a worthy follow-up to Moon that marks Jones as one of the best new filmmakers around.	2011-09-21
Duncan Jones's sophomore film, Source Code, is an assured second step into the realm of thoughtful science fiction.	2011-08-03
A casually brainy and surprisingly thoughtful blockbuster... that is ultimately as much about saving the day as seizing it.	2011-07-29
Since Source Code is philosophical science fiction and not just 'sci fi,' there's something to chew on here about consciousness: when it begins and ends, and that old chestnut of what constitutes reality. [Blu-ray]	2011-07-25
Zipping along at a speed to match the doomed commuter train aboard which most of its story takes place, Source Code is a tense, thrilling and unexpectedly emotional science fiction thriller.	2011-07-14
It's Groundhog Day meets Inception.	2011-06-16
Travels back in time and borrows liberally from the vaults of Rod Serling, and does justice to his legacy.	2011-05-31
This movie awakened my seasonal urge to buy ice cream treats and turn my brain off for 100 minutes, so get ready for summer, everyone.	2011-05-20
An entertaining, intelligent puzzle.	2011-05-16
Even when I thought I had the whole thing figured out early on, the movie allowed me to feel smug for a while before shooting me down. Brilliant.	2011-05-12
Smart and engaging, Source Code is a film that incorporates top class science fiction while debating the ethics of science fact.	2011-05-12
A film that moves our brains with even bigger ideas lurking just beneath the surface to give us plenty to think over upon leaving the theater. As long as you don't think about it too hard.	2011-05-11
The movie doesn't pull its punches, which are deep and lead to a sly kind of nirvana.	2011-05-06
While the end results are not as successful as Moon, it is still a decent mystery with intriguing philosophical implications and a fleshed out human drama.	2011-05-06
Great stuff: a film which will repay multiple viewings.	2011-05-06
At a nicely paced 93 minutes, Source Code is hard to go along with at times but it's an intriguing thriller that will hold your attention.	2011-05-04
A tremendously enjoyable trip to the movies, one that gets your blood pumping fast enough to keep your brain ticking.	2011-05-04
A thrilling and utterly brilliant mind-twister, which finds the human story amidst the edge-of-your-seat action.	2011-05-04
Source Code is the second feature directed by David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, after the excellent Moon a couple of years ago, and it confirms him as an astute and talented director of mysterious science fiction.	2011-05-04
Do not miss Source Code if you can at all help it. As a modern motion picture, this really is the complete package.	2011-05-04
It's an action film concerned with speaking and thinking, rather than shouting and exploding; each time the bomb goes off, it becomes less exciting, less of a focal point, until the most striking pyrotechnics on show are of the mental and emotional sort.	2011-05-04
Jones' smart handling of the genre is a breath of fresh air, but his messages feel slightly hampered by the bigger studio budget as opposed to his fabulous debut, Moon.	2011-05-04
Source Code is an enjoyable Hitchcockian thriller with a unique sense of humour that will serve Jones well; it is proof the young director is ready to handle cerebral blockbusters just like fellow Londoner Christopher Nolan.	2011-05-02
Colter, like Deckard before him, has to accept who and where he is, even as these definitions recede before him.	2011-05-01
The film is not a naturalistic drama; it's science fiction with a capital F. On its own terms ... Source Code is a decent effort	2011-04-30
Make every second count is the essence of this beguiling sci-fi thriller with parallel realities that plays with time and destiny as it explores a multi-dimensional view of time, life and its possibilities	2011-04-30
Moon director stays in sci-fi, keeps you in suspense	2011-04-29
Gyllenhaal brings essential emotional weight to the story and he's backed by a strong supporting cast.	2011-04-22
Doesn't it feel like this is a great premiere episode and we should be watching Season 1 on FOX in a few months?	2011-04-18
After I saw the thoroughly entertaining 'Source Code,' I felt as I did after seeing 'Inception.' My mind had been blown, numerous times. And I wanted to see the movie in a 'know what I know now' mode.	2011-04-13
A complex, compelling story, part Groundhog Day, part Inception.	2011-04-13
Culminates in a riveting, ingeniously plotted, and inventively shot 45-minute battle scene.	2013-11-07
Miike shows us the absurdity of war by showing us the thrill of war.	2013-06-23
Entirely too long, but the samurai game of cat and mouse, the strategizing, is fascinating.	2013-01-10
...a big movie that will overwhelm you with its scope, and it's hard to imagine anyone topping it any time soon.	2012-10-04
Consegue combinar uma abordagem mais classica, tradicional, aos toques de violencia bizarra tipicas da filmografia de Miike.	2012-07-18
13 Assassins evokes a classic filmmaking style sharpened by Takashi Miike's modern energy.	2012-01-29
A much fresher experience than would seem likely for such a well-trod genre.	2012-01-03
Miike's sadistic fetishization of violence and suffering is nowhere in evidence.	2011-12-15
A wildly entertaining blockbuster that should appeal outside the extreme Asian cinema niche market.	2011-12-07
I've seen enough of these samurai films to be in a position to say this one could be a considered a classic of the genre.	2011-11-23
Though it might look like a Kurosawa film, Miike brings to it a subversive edge of greater proportions.	2011-11-20
The excessive mind of Japanese director Takashi Miike (Audition; Ichi the Killer) throttles back the gore to deliver a disciplined, refreshingly grounded samurai action film.	2011-09-14
Miike plays it by the age-old rules, and the result, while undeniably entertaining, is unexpectedly tame, at least by Miike standards	2011-09-13
The once dormant samurai movie is rejuvenated in 13 Assassins, a spirited and violent romp which delves into the honour and savagery of samurai ideology.	2011-09-13
13 Assassins looks at honour from many angles, without becoming simplistic. Ichii hasn't lost his edge after all.	2011-09-09
I was engrossed by this film because it had tactics, strategy and characterisation.	2011-09-09
It doesn't feel like the tour de force it should be.	2011-09-09
The sense of loss, of waste, for a society, a culture, is just heartbreaking. That feeling is something special in a 21st century action picture.	2011-09-08
It pounds with blood-drenched action, but director Takashi Miike also offers up a thoughtful exploration of honour and loyalty.	2011-09-06
There are many deft touches, a sprinkling of humour and a great deal of grunting and shouting as men clash in hand to hand combat. But the supporting premise that this is a good fight to rid the world of an evil man gives the action moral traction	2011-09-03
Filmed with inspiration from Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, Takashi Miike delves into his nation's past to create a noble movie that will please fight fans but gives so much more thanks to a compelling story.	2011-08-27
While the characterisations are sometimes lacking, the swordplay never is.	2011-08-15
The action and spectacle in this film is outstanding making it one of Miike's best films to date.	2011-08-13
This is a gorgeous, technically flawless production, with a subversive bent I wasn't expecting.	2011-07-28
A remake of a classic film that is a classic on its own terms. Miike's battleground choreography in the final 20 minutes or so is cinema at its most sublime, a ballet of cruelty second to none.	2011-07-14
The grandiose concluding sequence is not staged with finesse or subtlety, but with brutal finality. It is the Japanese samurai film equivalent of a barroom brawl on an epic scale, and the violence is punishing.	2011-06-23
It's an incredibly violent, insanely entertaining movie that features scores of baddies getting killed by sword, arrow, knife, boiling oil, even a stampede of bulls. Wait, check that. Not just bulls. Flaming bulls.	2011-06-17
Familiar though it may be, as samurai movies go, 13 Assassins" is a killer.	2011-06-10
This slam-bang remake of a 1963 feature by Eichi Kudo builds slowly, accumulating characters and themes, then explodes into a prolonged and masterful battle sequence inside a deserted town.	2011-06-10
One can pinpoint the exact moment when 13 Assassins transforms from vivid samurai drama to insane work of genius.	2011-06-09
If you love action or samurai movies you cannot miss this film. To adapt Spinal Tap's line, this one turns it up to 13.	2011-06-04
If you can handle the blood, it's a very satisfying tale of vengeance and honor.	2011-06-03
Miike may have classed things up, but he certainly hasn't sold out.	2011-06-02
Epic. Unforgettable. Relentless. Magnificently entertaining.	2011-06-02
Though 13 Assassins' setup could stand some tightening, it's all necessary prelude to a spectacular, action-packed final hour where all hell breaks loose and the streets and rooftops flow with blood.	2011-06-02
Miike's movie is a creditable attempt at a chanbara and he takes the genre seriously	2011-05-30
Too much of a good thing - that's Miike's trademark.	2011-05-30
13 Assassins may well be the most wholly accomplished and satisfying film to come our way all year.	2011-05-28
The 13th assassin, an uncouth mountain man, offers a critique of his noble companions -- and of the code-of-duty genre he finds himself occupying -- when he comments: 'Do only samurai matter in this world?'	2011-05-27
It absolutely, undeniably delivers the goods. And those goods are soaked in blood.	2011-05-27
The final 40-plus minutes are bananas.	2011-05-27
Does Guinness World Records have an entry for longest on-screen fight? If it doesn't, Takashi Miike's "13 Assassins" just set it. And if a record actually exists, Miike's film just broke it.	2011-05-27
The dialectic about duty may not translate to a modern Western audience, but the savage sword-fighting is to die for.	2011-05-27
"13 Assassins" has what many action pictures need, a villain who transcends evil and ascends to a realm of barbaric madness.	2011-05-26
... a subversive, action-packed, beautifully crafted samurai revenge epic ... climaxes in a 40-minute pitched battle that utilizes sword, arrow, spear, slingshot and &#8210; here's a new one &#8210; burning bull.	2011-05-21
A richly cathartic experience with a wide range of emotional colors.	2011-05-19
13 Assassins is a savage, insane movie - in the best way possible.	2011-05-18
... the main attraction here is the big battle, for both its wild swordplay and the endless variety of clever devices and strategies the samurai come up with to even their odds against [the villains'] overwhelming numeric superiority.	2011-05-17
Cuts its way through a familiar samurai story.	2011-05-15
It's as if Miike wished to add his name to the list of old-time, classical action directors, alongside the likes of Robert Aldrich or Sam Peckinpah.	2011-05-13
I continue to be utterly taken with Midnight in Paris.	2014-06-01
It's charming and smart, and riddled with little joys.	2013-08-03
It's attractive and easy to slip into, but [Allen] didn't put enough thought into the design, and it soon falls apart.	2013-08-03
It lacks the humor of Annie Hall. It lacks the depth of Manhattan. But it manages to entertain, mainly as an homage to Paris - a romp through the city's intellectual and artistic history.	2013-08-03
Souffle light and long on charm, one of Allen's wittiest and certainly his most literary	2013-01-08
The blend of charm, magic, wit, and characterization come together to make this an engaging and intellectually stimulating experience. This is a great film and one of the best of the year thus far.	2012-09-20
The fact that Allen never explains how Bender bends time is a wise choice, there's no bogging down of the narrative which allows the flick to keep skipping along at a effervescent pace.	2012-08-27
Nostalgic fluff (for all its faux rejection thereof), but it's my brand of fluff	2012-07-21
[A] work of genius... [B]ecomes the butt of its own gentle joke... one that wraps up a paralyzing self-awareness in a redemptive self-deprecation to, finally and splendidly, laugh with great good humor at itself.	2012-02-15
As on-screen Allen stand-ins go, Wilson is definitely one of the more effective ones, recognizably channelling those Allen neuroses within his own established persona and distinct comic rhythms.	2012-02-07
Woody Allen seemed to have lost his fizz as a filmmaker of late - and then he uncorked the sparkling Midnight in Paris, a comic fantasy with all the effervescence of vintage champagne.	2012-02-03
Woody Allen's comedy Midnight in Paris is a superior late-period work precisely because it appears that age and wisdom have finally allowed him to discover that his romantic streak can acknowledge his realist/cynical side without succumbing to it.	2012-01-03
An accomplished film that's as entertaining as it is deliciously offbeat.	2011-12-29
Watchable, and on a certain level, it's quite enjoyable.	2011-12-29
[Woody] Allen brings his fantasy to life with such affection and joy that he transports us into his dream come true as a shared fantasy.	2011-12-22
A surprise treat from Woody Allen who has spent too much energy selling his films to mainstream audiences...	2011-11-30
einai apo aytes tis tainies poy se xaideyoyne epibrabeytika sto kefali, h anamesa sta mpoytia, giati exeis akoysta ton Cole Porter kai ton F. Scott Fitzgerald	2011-11-20
Allen wants you to love Paris as much as Gil does and wants to show you the magic, the romance and the spark the city holds for him.	2011-11-17
Filled with light-hearted fancy and a dazzling cast, Woody Allen's latest film is a magical stroll through a magnificent city	2011-10-24
Although the film suggests that we should enjoy the present for all it's worth, we have a great time enjoying this brief episode in a literate and beauty-filled past	2011-10-22
The magic of Paris and the mystique of an era gone-by are the stars of Midnight in Paris - Woody Allen's best film for years	2011-10-22
So light and breezy you might not recognize this Paris postcard comes by way of the ever-relevant Woody Allen, who mixes time travel and nostalgia to delightful effect...	2011-10-20
It's not a bad film -- it just could have been a lot better.	2011-10-20
Midnight In Paris is clever, watchable, mildly entertaining and quite amusing. Unfortunately -- after its initial gimmick -- it's also pretty predictable, and amounts to a lot less than the sum of its parts.	2011-10-20
The most acceptable Woody Allen film in a long time.	2011-10-20
This combination of whimsy and romance is, for me, much more successful than Allen's previous European city film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona.	2011-10-20
It's passable Woody waffle designed strictly for fans.	2011-10-20
His assembly of a beautiful montage of Parisian scenery that precedes the opening credits sets the unique tone Allen chases to perfection.	2011-10-20
Call it a fantasy or a rom-com or a satire or a travelogue - with this film, Allen's fearlessness declares he is past whatever label people place on his work. If you still feel the need, call it a love story - with a city, a memory, an art and a self.	2011-10-19
If you don't leave the cinema with a smile on your face, I'll be very, very surprised.	2011-10-19
Midnight in Paris is Allen's most charming, romantic and funny film in a long time.	2011-10-18
Beguiling, bewitching, enchanting, enthralling; Woody Allen has offered us a glimpse into his imagination, exorcised some (rather amiable) demons and shared with us one of the frothiest, funniest and most heart-warming films in years.	2011-10-17
Bravo, monsieur Woody!	2011-10-13
Midnight In Paris radiates positivity with its call to live life to the full and in the now.	2011-10-12
Recent Allen films have tended towards the perfunctory, often looking like a succession of clumsy first takes. In Midnight in Paris he is relaxed and confident.	2011-10-09
Allen at his sentimental best.	2011-10-07
Wilfully silly and heart-warming, this film is very easy viewing.	2011-10-07
Nostalgic and achingly beautiful, this is Allen's best since Husbands And Wives.	2011-10-07
A well put together exercise in the pleasures and pitfalls of nostalgia...	2011-10-07
Witty, featherlight and openly sentimental, this is Woody's love letter to Paris and the most relaxed, likeable movie he's made in years.	2011-10-07
It could have been shot down a country lane in Rutland, but Allen naturally preferred the charms, history and passions of Paris for a story that's both timeless and topical.	2011-10-07
An effervescent, witty and absorbing tale lost in time ... Allen rekindles his character love affair that made him such a satisfying film-maker a couple of decades ago ...	2011-10-06
Midnight in Paris contains sequences happier than can be described.	2011-10-06
Just when Woody Allen seemed to have written and directed himself out, he comes up with his biggest hit.	2011-10-06
Midnight in Paris is a breeze: a bauble, but a jolly one.	2011-10-06
A delightful exercise in wish-fulfillment, the picture is one of the most unashamedly romantic of Allen's career - if not the most - with hardly a trace of his cynical, caustic and darkly ironic take on the world.	2011-10-06
Only first-time visitors to Paris are in for disappointment: it simply can't live up to this.	2011-10-06
The time flies by, which is always a good sign. When it ends you realise that the plot is fairly insubstantial, but it's still a watchable, enchanting 90 minutes.	2011-10-06
If Allen's next stop on his Euro tour is anywhere near this enjoyable, consider our bags packed.	2011-10-06
In the face of a decade of cynical misanthropy, the optimistic and effervescent Midnight in Paris is Allen's most purely enjoyable work in years.	2011-10-06
One way or another you'll find yourself saying, "Awwwwww."	2012-06-15
Incredibly moving. Even if you don't have a three-story screen in your home, the film still works marvelously.	2012-04-17
Does a remarkable job of putting the viewer right with elephants in the Kenyan savannah and orangutans in the lush jungles of Borneo.	2012-04-07
It's entertaining, poignant, educational (at least for kids), inspirational, and certainly beautiful to look at.	2012-04-04
A terrific big-screen/3D film about the rescue of baby elephants and orangutans by dedicated humans introduces young people to a strong conservation ethic.	2012-01-04
Few will be unmoved by the two women's courage and persistence, though Morgan Freeman's intoning voiceover is less persuasive.	2011-06-17
A nice family outing, this, but those after an in-depth discussion had better look elsewhere.	2011-06-16
It's just 40 minutes long, but in that short time it produces more "awwww" moments than any feature-length film to hit theaters this year.	2011-04-27
Neither soppy nor schmaltzy, Born to Be Wild is a fascinating glimpse into another dimension of our world	2011-04-23
There are plenty of ooh and ah moments in this splendid documentary for all ages in which we are privileged to enter a special world where orphaned baby elephants and orang-utans are nurtured	2011-04-23
In Born to be Wild, the milk of human kindness nourishes the animals. And the audience.	2011-04-23
Invites you on a thrilling IMAX 3D cinematic safari to wildlife 'orphanages' in Kenya and Borneo, where baby elephants and orangutans are nurtured and trained to return to the wild.	2011-04-18
Trades on an indisputable fact: Ecologically friendly movies about cute animals are just about impossible to resist.	2011-04-15
'Born to Be Wild' is one of the finest films of the year. Anyone who ever has loved an animal in a wild environment (or, for that matter, shared a home with one) must see this extraordinary movie about animal rescue.	2011-04-13
... unusually deft for a 40-minute documentary ...	2011-04-13
There are three certainties in life: death, taxes, and Morgan Freeman's voice.	2011-04-13
I'm a fan of the diorama approach [to 3D], but Born to Be Wild makes the case that a nature documentary in IMAX 3D can and perhaps should bring us as close to the action as possible.	2011-04-12
David Lickely's work as a director is impressive and intimate, and the use of the 3D helps make it feel like you're there in the environments with these animals.	2011-04-12
What it lacks in length, the 45-minute movie makes up in entertainment value.	2011-04-10
This may make me sound like less of a man, but I'm going to say it anyway: Born to Be Wild is by far the most adorable movie I've seen in the theater in a long time.	2011-04-08
This enthralling 3D IMAX documentary about animal activists and naturalists in Borneo and Kenya and the orphaned baby orangutans and elephants they rescue is a must-see for animal lovers of all ages.	2011-04-08
A decent weekend diversion, this IMAX documentary is cute enough to engage your kids, while teaching them the most basic lessons in ecological responsibility.	2011-04-08
Their stories are touching and inspiring, but let's face it, the visuals are what make this movie. Born to be Wild takes you to places you've never been and makes you wish you had.	2011-04-08
The hip soundtrack adds momentum, and the reassuring narration of Morgan Freeman lets us know these lucky orphans will have a fighting chance for survival after taking their first steps -- or swings -- back into the wild.	2011-04-08
A cute and touching look at animals in peril and the dedicated humans who care for them.	2011-04-08
Given the sheer scale of the format, Imax provides an ideal context in which to experience 3D, allowing the eyes to wander about each periphery-filling frame and focus on whatever catches our interest, the way we do in the real world.	2011-04-08
Sweet, inspiring tale of two wildlife fairy godmothers.	2011-04-08
Born to Be Wild is a film you'll want to show your children. With any luck, it will eventually find its way into every elementary classroom.	2011-04-08
If you want to take a child to see something spectacular this weekend, even if it's only your inner child, skip that bunny movie and go to "Born to Be Wild 3D."	2011-04-08
While there's an important story here - how these two women take in endangered animals with the intention of later releasing them back into the wild - the main attraction is the general adorableness.	2011-04-08
It's sort of poetic justice that the wretched "Sucker Punch" is getting kicked off four Manhattan IMAX screens after just two weeks by this charming nature documentary.	2011-04-08
"Born to be Wild" is a good nature film - and a great technical achievement.	2011-04-08
A moving, engaging and revelatory IMAX attraction with two heroines and a crowd of charming beasts.	2011-04-07
Although it runs just a fleet 40 minutes, the film proves a rich and memorable journey.	2011-04-07
Narrated by Morgan Freeman (of course), "Wild" shifts gracefully between the two locations without ever feeling like it's imposing a story arc on them.	2011-04-07
Wholesome and educational, teaches right from wrong, and brings up some important environmental issues.	2011-04-07
Some animal parts, it turns out, are perfectly suited to 3-D, none more so than an elephant's trunk.	2011-04-07
Incredible and inspiring, educational and endearing	2011-04-07
An honest marketer might have just gone ahead and titled the film "Awwwww.''	2011-04-07
The "awwwww" factor is off the charts for Born to Be Wild.	2011-04-07
Parents should be prepared to dish out some of life's tougher realities on the drive home, when the "Daddy, what's a poacher?" questions will invariably arise.	2011-04-07
Born to be Wild is both grand spectacle and intimate tale.	2011-04-07
The spectacle of 3D and the narration of Morgan Freeman make clear the beauty of what is being lost.	2011-04-07
The film is short - clocking in at just under 45 minutes - but it is long on compassion.	2011-04-07
A helpful and healing documentary for families about the work of two woman who are caring for orphan elephants and orangutans.	2011-04-07
Everything a family movie should be: touching, funny and inspiring.	2011-04-07
Touching in a zoolike, rather than spectacular, way.	2011-04-06
Cute, but never insufferably so, "Born to Be Wild 3D" is best taken as the perfect film to transition your kids from animation to live action fare - short, sweet, and educational.	2011-04-06
Clocking in at only 40 minutes, the film has no time to thoroughly explore the issues at the heart of its bifurcated tale.	2011-04-06
WIN WIN makes Tom McCarthy three-for-three. Grabbing the affection from the audience is what he wants, and dear reader, he can't lose.	2013-08-28
McCarthy understands the thrill of incontrovertible victory and our primal lust for it.	2013-06-20
A thoughtful study of relationships and family dynamics, Win Win wrestles the competition to the ground.	2013-06-02
McCarthy has found his emotional sweet spot, a gentle and complex story to set it in and the perfect title for it."	2013-01-11
"Win Win" continues McCarthy's streak of bringing realistic characters and realistic situations to life on the screen. He has clearly shown his talent for writing and directing, making him one of those directors to watch out for.	2012-09-20
There's a real earnestness to the proceedings: if someone had relayed the setup to me via email or over cocktails, I would have bet heavily that we'd be looking at a sappy mess of cliches.	2012-01-13
One of the ten best films of 2011.	2011-12-30
Win Win is worth a look look. As indie dramedies go, it's a good one.	2011-12-29
Going down for a short count	2011-12-24
Excellent performances of good characters in a story that's not as rich as it apparently believes itself to be.	2011-12-23
In Tom McCarthy's Win Win sports may seem to be the means for drama. But when considering the importance of wrestling to the characters, the sport shapes character and narrative.	2011-12-11
This combination comedy and drama works well, in part because of good performances by everyone.	2011-12-03
Deftly illustrates how life is complicated and it is that rare family film that portrays life's real challenges without glossing over the complexities of relationships.	2011-11-08
Win Win isn't a morality play; it's just a really good story. But it does deal with an issue that couldn't be more relevant: Where do we draw the line when it comes to survival if it means clouding our sense of right and wrong?	2011-09-02
Is there anyone who can play an "ordinary guy" better than Paul Giamatti?	2011-08-18
Win Win is a warm, wonderful comedy, smartly written, full of great performances (particularly from supporting superstars Amy Ryan, Bobby Cannavale and Jeffrey Tambor) and bad haircuts (yeah, a lot of the characters have bad haircuts).	2011-08-17
Beautifully observed, this serio-comic film is the stuff of life and, despite the plot contrivances, very engaging in its quiet way.	2011-08-17
It's a wonderful screenplay; observant, wise and nonjudgmental, drawing out its universal relevance from an intimate and subtle story of human weakness and strength	2011-08-13
This beautifully realised independent film about winning and second chances is one of those gems that easily finds its mark	2011-08-13
A decent feel-good film, but I expected more from McCarthy.	2011-08-13
The rare, humanist beauty of Win Win is that none of its characters is a caricature, none of its plot twists a blatant play for tears or laughs, none of its appeal based on some mythical lowest common denominator.	2011-07-28
It's a familiar chain of events that resolves these issues, but where McCarthy veers from the mainstream is in his focus on the small lightbulb moments over the slow-motion slam-dunks that usually mark the reversal in fortunes.	2011-07-14
How often is my 'generosity' inspired by self-serving possibilities? Win Win is going to aggravate me for the rest of this year.	2011-06-15
You know, there is truth in advertising. Or titles, I should say.	2011-06-03
Thomas McCarthy's focus may be far more everyday than his previous films, but Win Win is a resonant, well-crafted drama with standout turns from the ever-brilliant Giamatti and newcomer Alex Shaffer, who is certainly one to watch.	2011-05-23
For all its cliches, it would be impossible to really dislike a film that's so innately inoffensive.	2011-05-23
Win Win manages that rare feat of being good comfort viewing without feeling too comfortable itself.	2011-05-23
Funny, compassionate and authentic.	2011-05-23
There are flips, bumps and falls before the resolution, and even if McCarthy ties up his various plot strands a little too neatly, the story will resonate with viewers suffering from recession blues.	2011-05-23
A deft, warm, serious and often very funny film.	2011-05-23
Cute and smart indie about ordinary folks in New Jersey and how they handle their small problems.	2011-05-22
It won't blow you away, but it remains a well-played and solidly entertaining family film.	2011-05-20
A slow-burn study of desperation eating away at the law abiding as they grow older.	2011-05-20
Moving, funny and thought-provoking - Win Win wins.	2011-05-20
Trying to please a crowd needn't be a shameful business. Tom McCarthy makes light comedies that notice the goodness and hospitality in unlikely people, yet stop short of sentimentalising them.	2011-05-20
Win Win is slighter, and sappier, than it might have been. Still and all, it's a joy.	2011-05-20
The picture aims for Little Miss Sunshine-like laughs and tears but isn't quite funny or dramatic enough although the characters are sympathetic and it's very nicely performed.	2011-05-20
Disappointing because it's a film from Tom McCarthy, the man who gave us The Station Agent and The Visitor. Win Win is equally humane, but just too cosy and pat.	2011-05-20
For all its witty observations on the trials of modern manhood, it never strays out of its blinkered suburban comfort zone.	2011-05-19
Riffs engagingly on the quiet desperation of ordinary, decent folk who find themselves in a fix, who take the wrong road for the right reasons.	2011-05-19
Honest, insightful, warm and witty. A proper delight.	2011-05-19
Giamatti strikes gold yet again, in another unassuming, self-depreciating powerhouse performance full of brilliantly acted nuances, in a story brimming with bittersweet moments.	2011-05-19
As with The Station Agent and The Visitor, McCarthy creates a series of encounters for some astonishingly vivid characters.	2011-05-19
While another actor might lose your sympathy, Giamatti effectively portrays the quiet desperation of a decent man on the edge, and it's his soul-searching turn that keeps you pinned to your seat.	2011-05-19
It's a true win, win.	2011-05-19
Although there are times when Win Win feels a bit self-consciously whimsical, it rings much truer than most.	2011-05-18
What's just delightful about this wittily observed and touchingly truthful affair is the fact it offers consistently sherbety entertainment in the moment but ultimately holds to its purpose of saying something useful and genuine about real lives.	2011-05-18
A hugely enjoyable, warm-hearted drama that's both funny and moving, thanks to a sharply written script, engaging direction and terrific performances from a superb ensemble cast.	2011-05-18
Funny, agreeable and thoroughly enjoyable, if a little bit too neat and fortuitous in sorting out its entangled strands.	2011-05-16
Trundles along for the most part in sitcom fashion, even down to the plinky-plonky background music.	2011-05-14
... slow and introspective, paced in long, still shots that seem to drift in time rather than march forward.	2013-03-23
Overwhelms us with meaningful silence.	2013-02-14
Shot in a series of long single takes in the remote reaches of a chilly landscape the film evokes how the acceptance of loss can bring a sense of peace.	2012-06-30
Full of striking visual images and fragmentary half-truths - a dour meditation on love and death that arrests and alienates in equal measure.	2012-06-24
The performances are pitch perfect. The culture is fascinating. See it. See it. See it.	2012-06-22
Aleksei Fedorchenko's crisp, beautiful film ponders the oddness and necessity of the folk rites in which we all seek solace.	2012-06-22
It is an odd, low-key film but the brief running time ensures that it never overstays its welcome.	2012-06-22
Fedorchenko may not exactly be on oath with all of these Meryan traditions of his, but they create an utterly distinctive world, and the close harmony provided by a choir in one scene really is arresting.	2012-06-21
A disarming tableau about life, love and death, Aleksei Fedorchenko's lyrical drama is soup for the soul.	2012-06-21
The wheels within wheels of sly tale-spinning turn quietly, turn deep.	2012-06-21
An incredibly moving and masterfully controlled experience.	2012-06-21
A beautiful piece of work: heart-wrending, atmospheric and truly poignant. Recommended.	2012-06-19
A meditation on death and sex, it's a melancholy and touchingly profound folk tale, though also deeply weird in places - pagan vajazzling, anyone?	2012-06-19
Beguiling, dreamy and mystifying. And quite unlike anything else. An unexpected cinematic treat.	2012-06-14
There's nothing here Andrei Tarkovsky didn't achieve in his prime, but at a mere 78 minutes it maintains focus with admirable purity.	2012-06-14
The finale may leave some unfulfilled, but this is an intuitive visual essay that begs to be experienced.	2012-05-20
If Silent Souls is slow and cryptic, with long takes and mysterious metaphors, it achieves a great sense of poetic realism	2012-05-16
Stunningly photographed for the wide screen SILENT SOULS is another indication that the Russian cinema, despite its problems, is still capable of producing major work.	2012-05-16
A resonant, lyrical and beautifully realised cinematic experience.	2012-05-15
Simple but not simplistic, Silent Souls resonates like a beautiful bell	2012-05-11
In spite of its exotic origins, 'Silent Souls' might best be described as a Slavic version of William Faulkner's 'As I Lay Dying.'	2012-01-20
It's lovely and slow and melancholic and short - 75 minutes, yet you feel you've been gone for an epoch or two.	2012-01-19
"Silent Souls" will not make it to the multiplex but that is OK. This is one for the real film buffs out there.	2012-01-18
Fedorchenko's wistful film has echoes of Parajanov magic realism combined with a Chekhovian melancholy. It's poetic in the most muted way, a chamber road movie.	2012-01-17
This beautiful, provocative film is like a road trip into a dream, an immersion into something quite mystical yet bound to the natural earth.	2012-01-14
An astonishing, haunting, sensual, lyrical, bleak and ultimately beautiful road-trip movie.	2011-12-22
Rife with earthy details and poetic associations, the movie often advances like a daydream.	2011-12-08
This profound and immensely touching film in only 75 perfect minutes achieves the profundity of an epic.	2011-12-08
The Russian drama unfolds as a series of perplexing, fascinating snapshots, yet the predominant story about saying goodbye - to people and customs - are universal.	2011-10-21
There's a trancelike quality to its best moments, but too much of it is artfully boring.	2011-09-23
An eternal love story on the frozen plains of Russia told as two friends journey on a wake in the ancient Merjan tradition.	2011-09-22
An astonishing work of art that has the visceral impact of Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring".	2011-09-17
Director Alexei Fedorchenko doesn't use sheer duration to immerse viewers in the spiritual journey. Not counting the credits, this beautifully photographed and quietly evocative movie is barely 70 minutes long.	2011-09-16
"Silent Souls" is hardly long, yet the camera's repeated focus on the wintry, gray country road they're traveling can feel somewhat ponderous -- like life itself, as one of the guys in the film might wryly point out.	2011-09-16
A melancholy poem to love, loss and the tug of tradition.	2011-09-15
fails to adequately capture a forgotten subset and trivialized culture disappearing in the heart of Russia	2011-09-15
An elusive, poignantly earthbound odyssey.	2011-09-15
The sincerity of the film's thoughts on loss and longing, on the burdens of grief, and on reawakened awareness of existence, is always painfully heartfelt.	2011-09-15
A somber but creative Russian drama about death, sex, friendship, and the lingering effects of an ancient pagan culture.	2011-09-14
Silent Souls is thrillingly dense and allusive, and the elegiac finale maintains the overall air of mystery while beautifully bringing all the disparate threads together.	2011-09-14
At 75 minutes, Silent Souls has the sustained flow of a musical composition.	2011-09-13
Fedorchenko's chief fascination seems to be with the dichotomies inherent in the modern rehashing of rituals based in folklore and mysticism.	2011-09-11
An ominous road trip of the surreal kind	2011-03-13
	2012-05-11
Relentlessly witless.	2013-03-14
Hasn't Al Pacino heard "Adam Sandler Sucks" before now?	2012-12-28
Jack and Jill is an ill-advised, too long Saturday Night Live skit gone wrong. It's a cartoon. It's a way for all involved to pad their pockets and a way for Sandler to keep his friends employed.	2012-09-22
Jack and Jill's lack of energy disguises contempt, but here [Sandler's] working through his issues in a more compelling way than usual.	2012-06-20
...another complete and total misfire from the once-reliable Adam Sandler...	2012-03-02
Burn this. This cannot be seen. By anyone.	2012-02-23
There appears to be no reason for the pitiless story this appalling movie has to tell beyond portraying Jill as an all-around despicable creature: socially inept and physically disgusting, incapable of grace and impossible to tolerate...	2012-02-18

The good news is that Sandler is marginally better in drag than he is playing himself.	2012-02-10
Why not go to your nearest hardware store, exchange your admission fee for a pot of emulsion, and watch that dry instead?	2012-02-08
It could easily have been a single-joke poster shot in a deleted scene from Funny People. Only it is less funny and less interesting.	2012-02-08
The worst representation of Jews on screen since Jud Suss.	2012-02-06
Dennis Dugan's film mixes slapstick and jokes about diarrhoea.	2012-02-03
Amazingly, Jack And Jill is even lousier than I feared it would be.	2012-02-02
Totally mediocre...	2012-01-31
Sandler's brash, unpretentious and unsubtle family comedy might be more enjoyable if it wasn't so mean.	2012-01-23
a film that may be remembered as one of the worst of the Wedding Singer actor's career.	2012-01-04
So unforgivably, soul-destroying bad it'll have you wishing Pacino had made Righteous Kill 2 instead.	2011-12-31
Why, Al Pacino, why?	2011-12-28
How much did they pay Pacino to do this? Four million dollars? Ten million? Who knows. But let's be very clear straight up: this is not Pacino's Being John Malkovich.	2011-12-07
Hastily assembled, uneven and severely lacking in charm and laughs, Jack and Jill is one of Sandler's weakest outings to date. Which is saying something.	2011-12-04
HEY LOOK, IT'S A CELEBRITY CAMEO! HEY LOOK, IT'S A CELEBRITY CAMEO! - See how annoying that is? Adam Sandler doesn't.	2011-12-02
Adam Sandler has succumbed to the Eddie Murphy syndrome. He's afflicted with the belief that we can't get enough of him.	2011-12-01
How will future generations judge us for the huge box-office love we've shown Adam Sandler over the years?	2011-12-01
If you're a lover of slapstick and find men dressing (very badly) as women amusing, this may hold your attention.	2011-12-01
Al Pacino is just about the lone standout in this shamelessly unfunny farce, which sees Adam Sandler give a one-note performance despite tackling two roles.	2011-12-01
There is so much bizarre imagery in Jack and Jill, Adam Sandler playing his own twin sister being the least of it... Are we sure Dennis Dugan isn't just the nom-de-plume used by David Cronenberg when he's feeling particularly playful?	2011-11-30
Fetching a pail of water would be more entertaining than watching this torture.	2011-11-25
Sandler tends to make films that tend to split moviegoers into two camps: those who consider him hilarious, and those who think he's a fart-joke man-child.	2011-11-23
Jack and Jill needs less Sandler, more Pacino.	2011-11-19
... the ultimate monument to gaucherie ... Pacino manages a few hard-earned gasps as he grovels on all fours after Jill. Needless to say, this is no 'Tootsie.'	2011-11-19
It's front-loaded with enough cameos from the likes of Regis Philbin and Drew Carey to sink most crappy comedies, and, indeed, this one finally makes it to an actual pleasure cruise, minus the pleasure.	2011-11-18
It's better than Bucky Larson... just barely, but it is.	2011-11-18
Not since Max Baer donned ringlets and petticoats to portray Jethro's sister, Jethrine Bodine, on 'The Beverly Hillbillies' has a drag act been as ghastly as the one perpetrated here by Adam Sandler.	2011-11-17
Aimed at the kids but provides a few chuckles for the adults too	2011-11-16
Unpleasant even by Sandler's usual standards, it's easily the star's worst film. And it co-stars Al Pacino. (It's his worst film, too.)	2011-11-15
One of the last lines by Al Pacino in the film is, "Burn this." I agree.	2011-11-14
Katie Holmes, on a rare furlough outside the Scientology Celebrity Center, mostly stands around and looks confused - maybe she caught a peek at the script?	2011-11-13
A clear sign that Sandler and director Dennis Dugan aren't even trying anymore, safe in the knowledge that fans will emulate Divine in John Waters' Pink Flamingos and chow down on whatever dog **** is presented to them.	2011-11-12
It's not hard to do but Jack and Jill has the distinction of being the worst Adam Sandler movie ever.	2011-11-12
Sandler's drag act becomes so excruciatingly unpleasant that it inspires involuntary shudders and post-traumatic nightmares.	2011-11-12
It's a downhill drag!	2011-11-12
What makes Jack And Jill worse than the average Sandler vehicle is Jill, who's been conceived as little more than a dude in drag, hold the jokes.	2011-11-12
Not since The Love Guru have I seen a film that was such an lazy, unfunny, utter failure in entertainment of all forms.	2011-11-11
Howard the Duck, Gigli, Showgirls, From Justin To Kelly. What do they all have in common? They're all widely considered to be among the worst big studio movies ever made. You know what else they have in common? They're all better than Jack and Jill.	2011-11-11
Forgive my stereotyping when I observe that most of the people who were laughing were also the same folks generous enough to share their cell phones.	2011-11-11
Someone please show this film to Morgan Spurlock! It should be renamed Dunkin Donuts Presents: Jack and Jill.	2011-11-11
Adam Sandler playing both an ambitious ad guy and his loser female twin is a brazen high concept that provides mostly comedic lows. But Sandler fans may welcome the brainless diversion.	2011-11-11
Sandler has become a good actor of late, but here he gives over most of his talents to Jill, who is so screechy, needy, and lovelorn that you can hardly blame Jack for wanting to fade into the background.	2011-11-11
The apocalypse starts here.	2011-11-11
This often risible mood piece stars Megan Fox as a circus sideshow attraction who has actual angel wings growing out of her back. Rather than doing the sensible thing and joining the X-Men, she instead decides to make out with Mickey Rourke. Go figure.	2012-01-16
full review at Movies for the Masses	2011-12-26
Perhaps it's needless to say, but Rourke and Fox are a thoroughly mismatched screen couple, who exude zero screen chemistry with one another.	2011-07-13
A vanity project from successful Hollywood screenwriter Mitch Glazer, this film should really be much funnier than it is. Oh, it's not a comedy, by the way. Not at all.	2011-06-27
Peculiarly bad. It's one of those total misfires that wanders so far off the track that you're left scratching your head.	2011-06-03
One of the funniest most pretentious art house flicks of the year...	2011-06-02
There's undeniable entertainment value in accidental absurdity, but Passion Play strikes a note of delirium that's downright painful to process.	2011-05-20
The very definition of a cinematic curiosity: a movie that seems almost too strange to exist.	2011-05-16
Mickey Rourke recently made headlines for dubbing Passion Play "a terrible movie," a proclamation that's ultimately most notable for its understatement.	2011-05-12
This underworld fairy tale is so soggy and sentimental it's like a new genre: Hallmark noir.	2011-05-11
Black Swan meets Water For Elephants, sort of. And is Mickey Rourke's male cougar character's obsession with his leading lady's wings in this post-mortem noir, possibly suspect intimations of either bestiality or necrophilia? Who cares.	2011-05-08
The net effect is as if someone had set out to imitate a David Lynch movie without ever having seen one, or as if it had been directed by Wim Wenders (which is approximately the same thing).	2011-05-08
Despite a gorgeous poster, a beautiful object of affection and cult-worthy actors, Passion Play fails to transform from a poetic pet project into a fully realized film.	2011-05-07
From the cheesy score to the nonsensical plot to the half-asleep performances, Passion Play is a snooze.	2011-05-06
Screenwriter Mitch Glazer's directing debut is a romantic fable about love, redemption and exquisitely art-directed squalor whose evident sincerity is overwhelmed by its utter ridiculousness.	2011-05-06
"It's like a movie," someone says at some point. Yeah, like one. But not quite.	2011-05-06
You almost wonder if the whole thing isn't just one big campy joke.	2011-05-06
Conjuring magic, it goes abracadabra and snaps its fingers, but nothing happens.	2011-05-06
You can do worse than a movie that features Megan Fox stripped down to her tattoos and Bill Murray as a pinstriped gangster who says things like, "Kill him and bring her back here."	2011-05-06
Graham Parker once said, "passion is no ordinary word." Here it's worth less than dirt.	2011-05-05
Every now and then a movie's awfulness rises to the level of mystery. How did it get produced? Did anyone try to save the filmmaker from himself?	2011-05-05
Even those with giant soft spots for beautiful catastrophes will be hard-pressed to find anything to like in Passion Play.	2011-05-05
Hard as it may be for Passion Play's principals to accept, some ideas were just never meant to fly.	2011-05-05
"Passion Play" would be midnight-movie fodder if it weren't so drearily wrapped up in its wounded-male aesthetic and a clumsy approach to art-movie moodiness that was abandoned in the '80s.	2011-05-05
so awkwardly assembled, so self-seriously preachy that it's actually exhausting to watch	2011-05-05
You have to assume the title is meant to be ironic since the one thing 'Passion Play' lacks more than anything else is passion.	2011-05-05
You can take the phoenix-rising actor out of straight-to-video trash, but -- well, you know the rest of it.	2011-05-03
Astoundingly bad. Unfathomably bad. As bad as any film Uwe Boll's ever made, and then some.	2010-09-21
Perversely eccentric and frequently inert, screenwriter Mitch Glazer's directorial debut, Passion Play, will benefit from some of the well-known names attached, but the near-painful hipness of the production will yield poisonous word of mouth.	2010-09-16
It's embarrassing for the stars because they try to take such putrid material seriously.	2010-09-13
If the degree of laughter at the wrong moments and the number of walkouts at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, the film will appeal only to the most fondly indulgent.	2010-09-13
A film that adeptly conveys his passion for the material (twenty years in the making), yet fails to hit the audience in that same engaging way.	2010-09-13
By the end of "Abduction," it's even becoming difficult for supporting actors like Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina to keep from laughing at the lunacy unfolding.	2013-06-22
Never goes far wrong as long as Taylor Lautner's in motion	2013-01-07
Lautner fans will enjoy five separate occasions where the star takes off his shirt but, for fans of worthwhile trips to the theater, Abduction is hard to recommend.	2012-10-02
Card-carrying members of Team Jacob may approve, but Abduction won't help turn Lautner into the action star he clearly aspires to be.	2012-09-24
In the end, we're left with a semi-interesting story that was poorly executed and poorly thought out with a bad lead performance that merely exemplifies the weaknesses of the script.	2012-09-19
The jury's still out on Lautner's leading man future.	2012-04-06
Even subtracting Taylor Lautner's mechanical performance, Abduction is an illogical train wreck riddled with messy direction, bad editing, tired action and plot holes galore.	2012-01-29
Lautner is a distracting screen presence; he's like a living Mort Drucker caricature or a 'motion capture' animated avatar of himself. Even so, he deserves better than this.	2012-01-12
Boring fugitive action-flick meets insipid teen romance. Well before the movie shows any hint of ending, you'll hope for a quick abduction, by any means, from the cineplex.	2011-11-11
The holes in the film's twist-filled story are often so big you could almost squeeze Lautner's sex appeal through them.	2011-10-18
At not a single point in this movie is anyone abducted.	2011-10-15
This uneven thriller alternates between fast-paced action and confusing plot situations, but Taylor Lautner takes his shirt off again to please his fans.	2011-10-15
... more twists and holes than a bad mountain road ...	2011-10-07
The dude is so wooden it's like watching Pinocchio with abs.	2011-10-06
Lautner makes a laughable attempt to become an abdominal-flaunting action star in this abominably directed spy drama.	2011-10-05
For an entertainment centering on teenagers the violence is, I think, excessive.	2011-10-02
You look at the screen mainly because it beats staring at the auditorium walls.	2011-10-01
The film's Pittsburgh location is used to nice effect but little else about the movie rings true.	2011-09-30
Some movies are hard to spoof.	2011-09-30
As a stupidly-entertaining, implausible and downright far-fetched action flick, this no-brainer does the job better than the recent 30 Minutes Or Less.	2011-09-30
The film has turbo-charged chases and fight sequences but the script is littered with unintentionally hilarious interludes and some excruciating dialogue.	2011-09-30
It left me wishing the scriptwriters had been kidnapped and told they would not be released until they came up with more than one original idea.	2011-09-29
Abduction is a brilliant action/thriller spoof that had me laughing from start to finish. Unfortunately, it is supposed to be an action/thriller.	2011-09-29
Sigourney Weaver? After Avatar, surely she doesn't need the cash?	2011-09-29
A serviceable if familiar premise is executed without thrills and excitement while Lautner doesn't have the necessary edge or charisma to carry the movie.	2011-09-29
When Taylor Lautner is the least of a movie's problems, be afraid.	2011-09-29
Taylor Lautner gets his first solo vehicle - but the wheels come off pretty quickly thanks to a clunky script, cack-handed direction and, sadly, Lautner's inadequacy as an actor.	2011-09-29
Yet another embarrassing squandering of John Singleton's talent, and proof that Taylor Lautner isn't ready to carry a film on his broad shoulders.	2011-09-29
...an almost-passable thriller that would've benefited from a much shorter running time...	2011-09-28
Lautner will likely get more chances to shine, but this is not his finest moment.	2011-09-28
Taylor Lautner plays characters with mysterious origins and makes them boring.	2011-09-28
[A] sleek-looking but mechanically dodgy vehicle...	2011-09-28
The reveal is so mind-numbingly stupid that it stops the film in its tracks and it gets progressively worse from that point onwards.	2011-09-28
Agent Cody Banks meets post-shark jump 24, with what appears to be an 8-year-old Soviet body builder in the lead role.	2011-09-28
There's a brief window... during which Abduction is good enough, which is obviously not the same as "good", but any port in a storm.	2011-09-27
While the ultra-banal dialogue draws the occasional titter, the action scenes are tame and it's rife with plot holes that you could navigate a burning blimp through.	2011-09-27
Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins are not ready for prime time and not ready to carry a movie.	2011-09-27
The movie is a more objective opportunity to assess Lautner's potential as a general-purpose action hero once his emo-goth run wraps. You might not want to go betting on that one.	2011-09-26
Filled with dialogue that hits the floor like syrup on a wet sponge, and chase scenes that barely register a pulse, "Abduction" is a less than disposable action thriller; it's pre-disposable.	2011-09-25
A blockhead espionage thriller from director-for-hire John Singleton (Boyz N the Hood).	2011-09-25
Perhaps the only way to approach Abduction that will not result in a 105-minute boredom-induced coma is to think of it as a comedy, preferably with a drinking game attached.	2011-09-25
Lautner's fun to watch, but the movie still wears thin, brought low by a useless and insufferable female lead and a plot that begins as cheerfully nonsensical and gradually grows into idiocy.	2011-09-25
Abduction needs two different reviews. For the Lautner fans, this is so the film you've been waiting for. For non-fans, it's full of holes, impossibilities and unintentionally hilarious dialog written by a sixth grader that doesn't get out much.	2011-09-24
This teen chase thriller is loaded with unbelievable plot devices, lame dialogue and yes, a leading man who just can't carry a picture.	2011-09-24
. . .a film containing both the dramatic depth and shelf life of an old issue of "Tiger Beat."	2011-09-24
This may not keep Team Jacob from sharpening its silver bullets, but I went into "Abduction" with no preconceived notions about Taylor Lautner. I wasn't the only blank slate in the theater. I just wasn't the one feebly trying to carry this movie.	2011-09-23
It's entirely forgettable, like Lautner will be once these last Twilight films work their way through Hollywood's lower intestines.	2011-09-23
The best unintentional comedy of the year.	2011-09-23
Underwhelming action thriller has deaths, violence.	2011-09-23
The movie travels down a bumpy road full of plot holes and left-turn logic that will have many in the audience chuckling at the idiocy of the various characters and situations. (Movie Review for Parents also available)	2011-09-23
Instead of attempting to create a unique thriller, the filmmakers chose to make a typical one with bland characters and lackluster twists.	2013-06-30
it's hardly worth sticking around for the routine climax of this toothless thriller just to see the ocular sweets get all chewed up and mangled.	2013-02-15
One dry hump of almost thrills that are incredibly lackluster and void of any sort of suspense or tension.	2011-12-12
the direction of the film is fraught with problems, and one feels that the promising young cast deserved better than this.	2011-09-01
A storyline that unimaginatively rehashes countless pivotal elements from other stalker-themed movies means that the whole production is a dull and pointless exercise that twists and turns in precisely the manner you expect it to.	2011-07-14
It might be genius compared to Single White Female 2: The Psycho, but know that The Roommate is ultimately about as sensitive as that dtv sequel sounds.	2011-06-26
It is as bland as movies get. There's not one single nod or wink to the audience and it never manages to develop even an iota of suspense. What's really weird is its complete reliance on a slick modern rock soundtrack that never seems to stop.	2011-06-05
More fun than getting stabbed, at least.	2011-05-13
... a Miss Teen "Fatal Attraction" &#8210; with baked kitten replacing rabbit stew on the menu.	2011-05-05
Christainsen chooses a teen-friendly rating over cheap titillation and his uneven tone squanders all the ingredients for a good horror movie completely.	2011-04-13
Christiansen's witless, badly acted thriller is a throwback to the early 1990s.	2011-04-10
Bunk.	2011-04-09
A disaster from start to finish.	2011-04-08
Elicits snores and guffaws thanks to workmanlike 'shock' moments and obvious twists.	2011-04-08
The biggest jolt the film can muster comes when the viewer's head hits the back of the chair after nodding off	2011-04-08
You could spend the entire movie texting your friends and not miss a thing, which I suppose its target audience may consider an asset.	2011-04-07
The plot never picks up steam, there are gaping implausibilities and the characters are achingly dull, with the exception of Billy Zane's hilariously smarmy and sleazy professor.	2011-04-07
There are some interestingly nasty moments and some chills, but it's predictable and derivative.	2011-04-07
The Roommate can't be taken seriously - for all Meester's genuine efforts, it's basically moronic games with the mentally ill - but it also misses the opportunity to go for broke, into a zone of full-tilt trash that might at least have been some fun.	2011-04-07
Billy Zane's toe-curlingly awful turn as a preening design professor turns out to be the main entertainment value on display.	2011-04-07
Lacking any suspense or twists, it's entirely predictable, with every step telegraphed in advance but none of the scenes played out with any conviction.	2011-04-06
Let down by a lazy script, a lacklustre leading performance from Minka Kelly and a frustrating tendency to cop out of the expected nasty moments.	2011-04-06
This is trash of the tamest variety which elicits a few mild shudders at most.	2011-04-06
Covering tediously familiar territory, this is only enlivened by the appearance of Billy Zane's fashion guru in a grey check tam-o-shanter declaring his love of Yves Saint Laurent.	2011-04-06
Lazy, ugly, boring, inept, brainless, pointless, bloodless, tension-less, idea-less, suspense-less, naked-less, acting-less.	2011-04-04
You can follow every dull detail and predictable plot device without ever glancing up from your cell phone.	2011-04-04
The cliches come thick and fast in this ponderous thriller.	2011-04-04
Cat lovers may be unnerved, but fright fans will just yawn their way to the exit.	2011-03-30
The Roommate has the seed of a promising thriller in its premise yet never taps into the anxiety of discovering that the person designated to share your space makes you uncomfortable.	2011-03-09
The blandest thriller unimaginable; it's like watching the vacuum of outer space on a screen for 93 minutes. The story and direction are so lobotomized, only some evil computer, using commercial-formulas and genre-algorithms, could have manufactured it.	2011-03-08
As interesting as its title.	2011-03-04
Evict this roommate.	2011-02-25
A timid psychological study with no plausible psychology at work, the film is remarkable in its emptiness.	2011-02-24
...an uneven, disappointingly tame entry within the otherwise solid blank-from-hell genre.	2011-02-15
A thrill-free thriller...which dredges up every cliche of the genre and then bungles each and every one of them.	2011-02-15
'The Roommate' is kind of a 'Single White Female' in a college setting. And it's not rated R, but PG-13, so the young woman demographic can enjoy getting scared.	2011-02-12
The saddest thing about The Roommate is how the filmmakers exploit the clearly ill Rebecca, turning her into a co-ed version of Jason or Freddy Krueger.	2011-02-12
So scare-free it's likely to find its destiny as a My First Horror Movie for tween-girl slumber parties.	2011-02-11
Further impediments to this film's credibility are the facts that all the actors appear too old to be playing college students and the characters live on a campus that is eerily deserted.	2011-02-11
This almost straight knock-off of 'Single White Female' is told in a colorless, A-to-Z manner with very little suspense, no clever twists, and no visual style.	2011-02-10
Roommate in need of eviction.	2011-02-10
A poorly directed and even more inadequately imagined exercise in genre calisthenics.	2011-02-10
It would be presumptuous to declare that in the first weekend of February, we've already found the worst film of 2011... but The Roommate encourages that kind of presumption.	2011-02-08
Lookalikes Meester and Kelly co-star in this frightless thriller. It is all predicable and has been done to death in many previous movies and TV shows.	2011-02-08
Kelly and Meester hit their marks and look pretty doing it, while supporting players Cam Gigandet, Billy Zane and Aly Michalka fade into the background so blandly that viewers will never remember they were there.	2011-02-07
The movie is exploitative schlock; both its&#8232; stars -- particularly Meester, who has something, although she herself has &#8232;perhaps not yet figured out what -- deserve better.&#8232;	2011-02-07
A suspense thriller sans the element of suspense is apt to disappoint even an audience arriving with low expectations.	2011-02-07
No scares, no gore, no boobs, no anything: The Roommate plays like a thriller that's already edited itself for airplanes.	2011-02-07
Lukewarm, sexually tinged thriller has some bloody scenes.	2011-02-06
"The Roommate'' is dumb about psychology and suspense.	2011-02-06
This is a sunken wreck from the get-go, and everyone involved knows it and just tries to get away.	2013-06-22
Dream House has been sold as a ghost movie but in reality, it is a psychological thriller mystery with a really bad ending.	2013-03-01
The only real mystery is why some A-list actors and a director of Jim Sheridan's calibre would even ponder working on such an uncalled-for project in the first place.	2013-02-15
So much is just so...obvious.	2013-01-31
At least Weisz and Craig wound up married after this mess.	2013-01-06
"Dream House" is a mess of a film. This is not only because its writing is amateurish, but also because the film itself seemed like it was someone's first attempt at putting a film together.	2012-09-19
Dream House is clearly something of a wreck, yet watching the film provides glimpses of the better film the project might have been.	2012-04-20
Dream House is not the film it was advertised as, but beyond the wonky finale, reshoots, and strange editing there is an interesting tale to be told here.	2012-02-12
It's little surprise that Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz disowned this turgid, woefully inept thriller which idiotically gave away its big reveal in the trailer.	2011-12-31
This is the kind of thing that happens when there is a squabble about who controls a movie. Director Jim Sheridan bickered with studio over how scenes in this thriller should be shot, and scenes were redone after test audiences reacted negatively.	2011-12-22
This is one property you'd do well to stay away from.	2011-12-01
It's daft and nonsensical. But it's that silliness and the sheer calibre of cast that ensure this has a certain car-crash watchability about it.	2011-11-27
Disappears up its own fundamental implausibility.	2011-11-27
The fragile hope that we might have a grown-up horror movie on our hands is smashed to smithereens.	2011-11-25
This is a workmanlike movie that is never quite scary enough, and never quite ingenious enough, though the four leads do an honest enough job.	2011-11-25
An intriguing twist livens things up midday way but the mood is almost oppressively melancholy and the plot doesn't stack up.	2011-11-25
Weisz and Watts are badly served by two dimensional roles and Koteas's part in the big picture is laughably obvious.	2011-11-25
Crowbarred into the standard haunted house chills is a supposed twist that feels like Shutter Island written for drunk people.	2011-11-25
A disappointing psychological thriller that's had all its noteworthy twists completely ruined by its trailer.	2011-11-25
An utter waste of time and talent.	2011-11-24
The film eventually descends into such violin-fuelled melodrama that it becomes a convoluted alternative to Kenneth Branagh's Dead Again.	2011-11-23
The premise may err on the daft side but it's played with conviction and an atmosphere of bleak dread is carefully evoked if not maintained until the final credits.	2011-11-23
A well-acted but ramshackle mess.	2011-11-22
Like most of its ilk, this starts off nicely but doesn't hold up to close rational scrutiny.	2011-11-22
There's an intriguing idea here, but this thriller feels like it has been compromised in the test-screening phase, resulting in a badly muddled plot.	2011-11-19
Misdirection might be a good word to describe this psychological thriller whose twist will either delight or annoy audiences. Give it credit for the surprise.	2011-11-08
...the incongruously over-the-top finale only confirm[s] the film's place as a hopelessly misguided piece of work.	2011-10-19
'Dream House' attempts to answer a question no one was asking. How long can a twist ending last? After the reveal, it's just a weird waste of time.	2011-10-11
Between its tell-all trailer and its tell-all poster, there's not much to tell about Dream House except that it's a crushing disappointment considering all the Herculean talent on display.	2011-10-07
This film is a confounding mess despite its impressive cast and director.	2011-10-07
It's not a bad movie, but it's been undone by incredibly stupid marketing.	2011-10-07
The movie tries to generate suspense where none exists; creepy music and clanging metal sound effects play over top of scenes where nothing is happening.	2011-10-06
Abruptly shifts midway from half-hearted haunted-house chills to sub-Hitchcock mind games.	2011-10-06
I want to defend Dream House, but it's just -- well, kind of indefensible.	2011-10-06
Dream House offers poignant look at madness.	2011-10-06
A completely ineffective and in no particular way incompetent movie that has absolutely no excuse not to be very good.	2011-10-05
Starts out with an interesting premise but then the whole thing just falls apart.	2011-10-04
a rather lumbering vehicle that runs primarily on formula and (pseudo)psychological ploys that we have seen too many times at this point to warrant much excitement.	2011-10-03
The final wheeze of the J-horror-inspired domestic thrillers that ran rampant a few years back.	2011-10-03
Some scripts should never be made into movies. This is one of them.	2011-10-03
Clearly it's one of those movies being dumped in September, but thanks to the cast, I was never bored.	2011-10-02
Was the screenplay, credited to David Loucka, this schizophrenic from the beginning? Or was some major tampering/reworking done at some point?	2011-10-02
The accumulating weirdness never becomes all-pervasive eerieness, much less terror, though Craig gives Will's descent into confused madness a raw and potent edge of despair	2011-10-01
Hard to believe such a hokey, stupid film could attract so much talent.	2011-10-01
A suspense thriller that's neither thrilling nor suspenseful.	2011-10-01
More like a narrative nightmare...just lays there on the screen, attractive to look at but horribly sluggish and, in the end, almost criminally stupid.	2011-10-01
... one of those neither/nor concoctions that usually results when a non-genre director goes slumming ... Sheridan's first fright film, when not outright hilarious, is neither chilling nor compelling.	2011-10-01
Tiresome and tedious, it's destined to foreclosure.	2011-10-01
The real mystery here is how this mess of a movie got such a stellar cast.	2011-10-01
This suburban gothic is a logy, convoluted mess.	2011-10-01
Offering up genuinely unlikable characters and terrible dialogue, this comedy qualifies as one of the year's worst.	2013-06-30
The bland lead the bland through a sea of New Year's revelers...	2013-01-05
Colossal waste of talent and time.	2012-06-03
Your appreciation for the film may depend on your tolerance for sugar.	2012-04-26
Among the year's worst films. The tragedy is funny, the comedy is tragic, and about its only saving grace is that it makes 2010's Valentines Day look almost passable.	2012-03-22
...a perfectly watchable (and consistently hackneyed) feel-good ensemble drama.	2012-01-31
The cinematic equivalent of a piece of New York style cheesecake and about as artistically satisfying.	2012-01-09

New Year's Eve is pretty much laugh-free, trading on tired visual gags and some unbelievably cynical 'cutesy' scenes (baby montage anyone?) for most of its humour.	2011-12-23
Garry Marshall, how could you? You have made a mockery of a movie that bears the name of my birthday. I take this as a personal affront.	2011-12-17

Proves, in its tiny way, that no matter how bad the modern romantic comedy has already become, there's still plenty of room for it to get worse.	2011-12-16

New Year's Eve is like Woody Allen lite for the masses ( ... ) by never threatening to copy the smut of 50/50 or Bridesmaids, it's a memory-stirring, warm-hearted breath of fresh air. Even at 117 minutes.	2011-12-11
An onslaught of schmaltz, passing off greeting card platitudes as dialogue and repeatedly reminds us the end of one year and the beginning of another is about second chances, hope and forgiveness.	2011-12-10
All human life is here in predictably two-dimensional form, ready to confront 2012 with a brave face, a throbbing heart and a head unclouded by economic worries.	2011-12-10

Forget counting down from 10 as the ball drops in Times Square; here instead is a countdown of the 10 key points in New Year's Eve, which proves to be even tougher to take than director Garry Marshall's previous all-star holiday romp, Valentine's Day.	2011-12-10
I think I read about this somewhere in the Book of Revelations (ya know, somewhere between forty years of darkness, and the dead walking the Earth).	2011-12-10

New Year's Eve feels like a film made by an entire cast and crew that has never actually celebrated New Year's Eve.	2011-12-10
...while generally uninvolving, it's a nice, moral, family-oriented film, better than sitting through many of the others that are out there right now.	2011-12-09
The cinematic equivalent of a glass of flat champagne.	2011-12-09
New Year's Eve actually has more in common with the day that proceeds the alcohol-soaked holiday ... it's the kind of experience that will leave you nauseated, give you a splitting headache and cause you to curl up on a couch in the fetal position.	2011-12-09
New Year's Eve is a perfect example of why the adjective "Hollywood" is so often used as a pejorative.	2011-12-09
A big dumb mess.	2011-12-09
The only entertaining way to watch New Year's Eve is as a cruel experiment in which performers stranded with absolutely no script support are forced to subsist on pure presence, which quickly becomes a blood sport in which only a few survive.	2011-12-09
When a cameo by Matthew Broderick is just a set-up to name his character "Buellerton" it's time to ring in the New Year and call it a night.	2011-12-09
Rivals Gigli as one of the most cringe-inducing, asinine and silly romcoms in quite some time. Save yourself the torture and just rent Love Actually instead.	2011-12-09
It's all edited with a Cuisinart, such that when a character you last saw 20 minutes ago (the movie's an excruciating two hours) pops up again, you have to remind yourself who they are.	2011-12-09
Written on the level of a bad episode of The Love Boat, this is one of those concoctions that intertwines about 10 storylines and then concludes with a cherry on top.	2011-12-09

So garish and manipulative that it doesn't really qualify as a film -- it's a product, no more an actual movie than a Hallmark card is a piece of poetry.	2011-12-09
To say "New Year's Eve" is cheesy is an understatement. Love struck people running around and trying to have a good time. But that is also what makes the film fun.	2011-12-09
Should auld acquaintance be forgot? I don't know, but "New Year's Eve" sure should be.	2011-12-09
The worst sin of 'New Year's Eve' is the insulating presentation of New Year's Eve in the Big Apple. Hopefully, no one thinks New Year's Eve in New York City is this boring, cliched and common.	2011-12-09
One can only hope that enough viewers make a resolution not to support cinematic flotsam like this (Parental Movie Review also available)	2011-12-09

This is a movie where Zac Efron teaches Michelle Pfeiffer to say yes to life. This is a movie where Zac Efron is a real chill bro who can inspire people to say yes to life.	2011-12-09
Dylan Dog: Dead Of Night is a fun comedy/horror whodunnit with a supernatural twist. It delivers plenty of movie fun too, just like those campy 80's monster flicks.	2013-03-25
Fun performances from Routh and Huntington can't make up for an extremely convoluted and mostly soulless story -- even when there's a giant zombie running around.	2012-10-02
A pointless, very loose adaptation of the popular Italian comic that plays like a bad episode of Buffy.	2012-01-29
Dylan Dog works best when it has fun with P.I. conventions; when the monsters take over, it goes downhill.	2011-12-29
The movie wants to be a combination film noir and horror comedy, but the timing is all off and the performances are flat across the board.	2011-09-09
the whole shebang plays out like a twisted Murder She Wrote episode	2011-08-25
...a disappointingly lifeless adaptation...	2011-07-26
Entirely derivative and utterly wretched.	2011-05-17
Isn't awful, but it is awfully familiar,...coming across as something that might appear on the SciFi Network on a Saturday night.	2011-05-15
There's one fight scene involving a rope and a pulley that briefly lifts the general torpor, but as soon as that's over, it's back to snoozeville.	2011-05-13
Everybody else will have a better time revisiting Monster Squad or falling asleep.	2011-05-13
The film longs to be a hip skewering of noir and monster movies but instead is kneecapped by mediocre effects, indifferent performances and a generally dull design.	2011-05-09
Even if the whole vampires vs. werewolves thing hadn't already been done to un-death by True Blood and the Twilight and Underworld franchises, Dylan Dog would still be a crushingly dull 107 minutes.	2011-05-06
For having such an inspired start, the movie feels oddly uninspired.	2011-05-06
Director Munroe is clearly a fan and attempted his best on an admittedly limited budget, but some things just don't translate that well.	2011-05-06
The story is even staler (and the production cheesier) than the jokes ...	2011-05-06
"Life is wasted on the mortals," says an elder vampire. Even more so, I'm afraid, on this movie.	2011-05-05
It's not so much that Dylan Dog is bad -- certainly nowhere near as bad as is being claimed -- it's that it's so completely inconsequential.	2011-05-05
Out of nowhere comes Brandon Routh and into nowhere he returns.	2011-05-04
If you haven't seen "Cemetery Man," director Michele Soavi's 1994 avant-garde adaptation of Tiziano Sclavi's Dylan Dog novel and comic books, I highly recommend checking it out rather than wasting your time on this muddled piece of filmic tripe.	2011-05-03
If you are looking for a great horror comedy as a quick fix, check out THE FRIGHTENERS, BEETLEJUICE or even the cinematic take on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, you'll be a happier and healthier person for it.	2011-05-03
Anne Rice meets R.L. Stine. No, that's not a compliment.	2011-05-02
In the future, filmmakers will once again produce fun, entertaining and original films about vampires, werewolves and zombies. But until then, Dylan Dog: Dead of Night argues for a moratorium on movies about these three terrible creatures.	2011-05-02
While he's fine playing bemused and beleaguered, Routh can't muster the edginess that Dylan is also meant to have. Diggs looks fabulous, but has his own problems with the dangerous stuff.	2011-05-02
has the overriding sense of going through the motions, with only a few moments of genuinely effective humor	2011-05-01
With terrible acting, a narrative on autopilot and chaotic blurs passing for action scenes, it's a direct-to-DVD caliber sojourn through the dregs of comic book adaptation.	2011-04-30
Brings vampires, werewolves, zombies, detective noir and spoofy comedy together for a murky genre gumbo with barely any flavor.	2011-04-30
A monster mash and genre mash-up that leaves one pining for the swagger of Hellboy.	2011-04-29
a lazily-assembled greatest-hits collection of horror iconography stitched together with little depth, less purpose, and almost no entertainment value.	2011-04-29
A cluttered, uninspired hash of familiar genre ideas.	2011-04-29
I wanted to enjoy Dylan Dog: Dead of Night, if only because films of this ilk are rarely produced anymore. However, it's a bust. An extraordinarily talky, tedious, unmonstery bust.	2011-04-29
Lets the likeable erstwhile Superman do his best impression of a jaded P.I., down to one of the most ineffectually boyish attempts at a grizzled voiceover in memory.	2011-04-29
Put a stake in this film noir monster movie, it's done.	2011-04-29
Never mind that Dylan Dog: Dead of Night is loosely based on an Italian comic series from the 1980s; this low-rent adaptation owes an embarrassingly big blood debt to HBO's True Blood.	2011-04-29
Don't worry if you're not familiar with the obscure source material. There are plenty of other sources of disappointment to be found in director Kevin Munroe's B-movie mess.	2011-04-29
Dylan Dog: Dead of Night's not too mysterious; don't take it too serious, and you'll have a fine time.	2011-04-29
As the title character, Routh has to carry the movie with bravado and charm, appearing in most every scene, narrating in the style of a hundred film noir private eyes. And he just doesn't have it.	2011-04-29
While it has its charms -- due mostly to the chemistry between Routh and Huntington -- Dylan Dog: Dead of Night ultimately plays like a lesser episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.	2011-04-28

While it's nice to see renewed interest in genre fiction from a teenage girl standpoint, these new monsters don't have much bite to them.	2013-09-16
Gary Oldman is the one bright light in this tired drama that deserves neither his talent or your time.	2013-06-30
'Beware the wolf,' warn Red Riding Hood's posters and television ads. Be even warier of this movie.	2013-06-28
Trite dialogue, poor special effects and an insubstantial storyline make this one a bit of a dud.	2013-06-02
The CGI wolf would have been rubbish a decade ago, the clearly indoor village set looks like it once featured in an old episode of Star Trek and the central love story is lacking in bite.	2013-03-14
For all the heaving bosoms, the big-eyed flirtation and the cool Medieval fairytale hair products, it doesn't work.	2013-01-19
With this film and the first "Twilight," Hardwicke has shown that she doesn't have much talent for direction and that she isn't that good a judge of material if this is the kind of film she keeps choosing.	2012-09-21
Catherine Hardwicke, what the Hell happened?	2011-12-31
it perfectly sums up the muddled feeling of a gothic horror romance that never feels all that romantic nor particularly scary.	2011-09-16
Sexualising a beloved children's fairy tale seems an odd move, but when flanked by an unoriginal story and lacklustre performances, that appears to be the least of the film's problems.	2011-09-01
"Oh my God, you can talk," Valerie exclaims at one point when confronted by the wolf (he can't). Oh my God, I've wasted almost two hours of my life in this theatre.	2011-08-16
Have you had questions about the motivations of the wolf, or suspicions about Grandma? Have you pondered the sexual connotations of this age-old fairy tale? Me neither. Just the same, someone has made a movie about...	2011-07-18
Like Twilight, makes the shallow desire to run away with a boy the heroine's main concern.	2011-07-15
Bloodless on every level.	2011-07-14
What truly needs abolishing is the notion that the wretched Twilight saga is worth emulating.	2011-06-24
This one's a retake on 'Twilight.' I'd hang out in a different hood if I had the chance.	2011-06-16
... this gorgeously-mounted production fails to rouse the primitive ferocity of the primal beauty and the beast tale.	2011-06-14
Mildly diverting if you're curious, but don't expect to be blown away.	2011-06-13
Mixes the melodrama of Twilight with the hokey horror of The Village but falls short of being 'so bad its good.' It's just not good.	2011-05-12
This movie is just a lot of people staring at each other by the light of a fire.	2011-05-06
We always suspected the kid in the red cloak had a dark side. The new "Red Riding Hood" starring Amanda Seyfried confirms our suspicions.	2011-05-04
Dismal failure is redeemed only by the occasional inadvertent laugh	2011-04-29
Neither a horror film nor an effective teen-skewing romantic fable, Red Riding Hood fails to find the teen lit niche it seeks.	2011-04-27
The whole Twilight lusting-to-lose-her-virginity-to-her-true-love story falls even flatter in a Grimm historical setting. Anachronistic, true-romance cliches sap the plot's strength, while the visuals get more and more predictable.	2011-04-25
Social and sexual tension is nil, thus making a perfect fit with the clawless drama.	2011-04-22
Evokes less menace than a Teddy bear's picnic and is as disappointingly reactionary as the Bella Swan brigade.	2011-04-20
A boring mess, neither scary nor sexy enough to justify its innovations.	2011-04-20
The heart of the teenage girl may well be a dark forest - but never one quite so naff as this.	2011-04-15
Every time Hardwicke's film threatens to veer into dark, unsettling territory, it's sweetened with sickly sweet romance.	2011-04-15
The result is a curious beast, part whodunit, part teen romance, and all of it a clunker.	2011-04-15
Grim not Grimm.	2011-04-15
There is no sexual or romantic chemistry.	2011-04-14
Really, werely disappointing.	2011-04-14
The plot proves surprisingly suspenseful as, Agatha Christie-like, the culprit could be anyone.	2011-04-14
The Company of Wolves did it so much better back in 1984.	2011-04-14
Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? No one who sees the specimen in Red Riding Hood, that's for sure.	2011-04-14
Is this supposed to be funny?	2011-04-14
Red Riding Hood is a fantasy fairy tale with a twist of Twilight, but it doesn't quite come together, despite some striking images and a strong performance from Seyfried.	2011-04-14
Twilight without any heat, feeling, fun or sparkly skin. Yes, it's that lame.	2011-04-13
At once a lacklustre tale of star-crossed lovers and a whodunit of staggering mediocrity.	2011-04-13
Disappointingly, once again Hardwicke relies more on visual appeal than decent dialogue. But teenage girls, for whom this movie is made, will lap it up.	2011-04-13
The village looks like an Amish suburb of LA peopled by dentally-perfect specimens with Hollywood hair and rustic smocks by Donna Karan.	2011-04-13
Yes, there's enough connection with the source's underlying issues of repression and desire to give this reason to exist, but, boy, does Hardwicke labour in getting from fairy tale to would-be psycho-thriller.	2011-04-13
Best trip to Grandma's House ever.	2011-04-12
It feels like a mopey medieval Twilight flashback livened up by the odd bit of overacting.	2011-04-12
Red Riding Hood is actually a fun, goofy ride, albeit one lathered in chintz and froth.	2011-04-11
Oldman and Seyfried prove to be the big attractions, but Hardwicke's Riding Hood legend still lacks bite.	2011-04-11
The Red Riding Hood trailer was roundly mocked by some sceptics, who said it looked like Twilight in a puce cloak. A disgustingly cynical notion...that's turned out to be one hundred per cent correct.	2011-04-09
It's the seriousness with which Hardwicke treats the tale that proves its undoing.	2011-04-07
If you're watching any big Hollywood movie that thinks it's smarter than you, you can generally figure that kind of thing out all by yourself long before the protagonist.	2011-04-04
The filmmakers try to use special effects to cover up the weaknesses of the story, but even on that point they fail pretty badly.	2012-09-21
Not the stinker that everyone says it is, but you do have to ignore its flaws in order to be entertained.	2012-05-04
After a while, the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money.	2011-11-24
Another forgettable trifle from Cage.	2011-10-07
It's an Uwe Boll kind of film that's been directed with a certain degree of competency by previous Cage collaborator Dominic Sena.	2011-08-25
Have low expectations for this movie and you might just be surprised.	2011-07-14
I may be in the minority of critics to think so, but Season Of The Witch is an enjoyable medieval thriller that's well-made in spite of some moments of silliness.	2011-07-12
Although I will likely be disemboweled from my toes to my nose (metaphorically speaking only, I hope) for this proclamation, I didn't think Season of the Witch was all that bad!*	2011-07-06
Cage's disappointingly subdued performance stands as the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back...	2011-07-01
God's teeth!	2011-06-29
Guns are fun in movies, but bashing about with broadswords speaks to the 12-year-old in all of us.	2011-06-22
Director Dominic Sena sets a quick pace; the dull moments are brightened by the unexpectedly likable team of Cage and Perlman.	2011-04-04
For long, long stretches, [it's] too leaden and dour to be any fun at all.	2011-04-04
It's amazing how little entertainment value there is in watching Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play world-weary Crusaders in a movie called Season Of The Witch. Come on! It's Ghost Rider and Hellboy!	2011-04-04
Anti-Oscar-movie people, this one is for you.	2011-04-04
Just how big was that IRS bill, anyway?	2011-03-06
It's a bit cheesy but there is action and tension and strong graphic effects - and even a deadpan moment	2011-02-26
Avoid it -- wait for it -- like the Black Plague.	2011-02-10
A Nicolas Cage movie where Nicolas Cage doesn't lose his shit. Avoid.	2011-01-26
Spellbinding it's not.	2011-01-20
Witch's Spell only Partially Effective	2011-01-18
From script to editing, this Witch doesn't float.	2011-01-18
Nicolas Cage=Modern Day Bela Lugosi in Declining Years	2011-01-15
Begins with a bang (a hanged witch rises from a watery grave to dispatch her tormenter) but ends with a thud (a bungled exorcism releases a silly-looking computer-animated demon).	2011-01-14
This painfully earnest and overblown medieval swords-and-sorcery road movie is unlikely to warm the cockles of any but the most die-hard fans of Cage's stentorian growl and arch overacting.	2011-01-14
Director Dominic Sena is more like a less amusing Uwe Boll than Ingmar Bergman.	2011-01-12
Dominic Sena directs all this stuff and nonsense with a paucity of fun unbecoming a loopy tale of medieval witches starring Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman.	2011-01-12
Cage is effective as a falling down drunk in Las Vegas or a treasure hunter navigating goofy road trips but not as a disillusioned champion of the Church going one-on-one with a demon. Steven Seagal would have been more believable.	2011-01-12
Poor plot twists and CGI-heavy action further muddle what might have been an intriguing story of fanaticism and superstition.	2011-01-12
It's Centurion Deux without the second-coming-of-Carpenter pretense, though you still wish the trashiness were more distinctive.	2011-01-12
Season of the Witch suffers from a general laziness.	2011-01-11
How many mediocre movies can Nicolas Cage make and still have a career? I guess we will wait and see.	2011-01-11
A cursed abomination...as a priest observes, 'We're going to need more holy water!'	2011-01-11
The only time I was even modestly entertained was when the 10-year-old boy sitting behind me (obviously taken out of school to see the film by his model parents) started belching unrelentingly at the screen.	2011-01-10
Makes The Last Airbender look like Avatar.	2011-01-10
Did they really say "I've saved your ass" in medieval Europe?	2011-01-10
While certainly no Witchfinder General, it doesn't deserve to be burned at the stake.	2011-01-10
'Season of the Witch' entertains, but don't get me wrong, it's a bad movie.	2011-01-09
This is the puffy-faced Nic Cage. The one who fights for Christ and Little Debbies and not necessarily in that order.	2011-01-09
[VIDEO] This movie sucks so awfully that you'd think it was a vicious prank.	2011-01-08
It will probably be the worst reviewed movie of the year, it may break up couples mid-date night, and fraternities are sure to use it in tandem with contraband beverage Four Loko for Hell Week hazing. But come on, it's not that bad.	2011-01-08
Authenticity takes a back seat. Swordfights, wolf-punching and zombie monks clamber into the front seat and smash a hole through the windscreen.	2011-01-08
You've seen more convincing medieval performances from guys at Ye Olde Pancake House after a LARP scrimmage. With all the dead birds and fish, this might seem like a timely piece of apocalyptic fiction. But such pestilence is annual par for Nicolas Cage.	2011-01-08
We need a serious suspension of disbelief to accept these two aging actors as faultless warriors in tip-top shape.	2011-01-08
Disregards characters, emotions and even dramatic tension in favour of an endless parade of 'cool shit' to impress its perceived audience of 13 year olds.	2011-01-08
It's The Seventh Seal meets Get Him to the Greek meets Lord of the Rings as if filtered through Uwe Boll's hack-tastic brain.	2011-01-07
Even an actor like Nicolas Cage cannot elevate such a disappointingly anachronistic and incoherent religious epos.	2011-01-07
You'll want to spend lots of time checking out those costumes, because, Perlman and Lee aside, there's not much to watch in the acting department.	2011-01-07
If it's January, it must be time for another Nicolas Cage film	2011-01-07
Because this is the first release of 2011, it would too be easy to crown "Season of the Witch" the worst film of the year, but I'm sure it will live up to that title for weeks to come.	2011-01-07
While the plot of Argo sounds too unbelievable to be true, this fact-based story ends up as both compelling and as exciting as any adventure James Bond ever had.	2014-01-10
By not pandering sentimentality, Affleck has managed a task that, like its subject, seems impossible: He's taken what others would have turned into farce and emerged with one of the year's best pictures.	2014-01-10
Ben Affleck's wildly entertaining thriller Argo is further proof of the old Hollywood adage that fiction is stranger than truth after all.	2014-01-10
The film hits most of its comic notes on the backs of two Hollywood old-timers played by Alan Arkin and John Goodman, who clearly relish the opportunity to lampoon people they work with every day.	2014-01-10
This is mature, invigorating stuff, alternately tense, funny, stirring and ultimately very satisfying.	2013-07-20
This is premium, breathless entertainment.	2013-06-23
Entertaining and suspenseful in old-fashioned ways.	2013-06-14
A superior effort in which Affleck seldom fails to maintain suspense.	2013-05-13
The film, for all its ample smarts and solid academic craft, is just a great time at the movies.	2013-03-31
... a terrific piece of filmmaking.	2013-03-24
Ben Affleck is one of this generation's best directors and "Argo" is a tight, engaging thriller.	2013-03-21
Argo is director Ben Affleck's weakest effort by far, but still a well-made, performance-driven historical drama.	2013-02-23
The only reason to watch Argo is because it's heavily padded, and while it works pretty well regardless, I wouldn't hold that up as an example of high quality filmmaking.	2013-02-19
Ben Affleck is a director who appreciates the art of storytelling and masters the rare virtue of restraint...	2013-02-11
The sky's the limit for Ben Affleck right now, and its nothing less than he deserves.	2013-01-20
Affleck spins the absurd true story into an engrossing espionage thriller that would be utterly ridiculous if the stakes weren't literally life-or-death.	2013-01-08
After Gone Baby Gone, The Town and now this directorial-best, Affleck is establishing himself as a major craftsman.	2013-01-08
Affleck himself turns in a quietly impressive movie star performance. Tony Mendez is a kind of anti-Bourne, comfortable with his anonymity, living off his wits, not his fists.	2013-01-04
Affleck inserts such thoughtful commentary and ideas unobtrusively into his film; there's no ideological ball-peen hammer from the filmmaker to drive his beliefs into the audience.	2013-01-04
Argo expertly builds tension and makes you wonder whether the mission will succeed.	2013-01-04
There are many heroes in Ben Affleck's spunky, polished political thriller. But the biggest hero is Hollywood itself.	2013-01-04
A strong yet uneven effort...	2013-01-02
We are invested in this rescue mission not simply because these are fellow Americans in peril, but also because Argo takes the time to make each person behind enemy lines unique and authentic.	2012-12-31
An edge-of-your-seat thriller not to be forgotten at Oscar time!	2012-12-29
'Argo' only clocks in at a two-hour running time and tells a much better story than the films that over-stuff audiences with nearly three-hours.	2012-12-28
Second billing to unabashed jingoism	2012-12-26
This may be the most geek-friendly movie that never did the rounds at Comic-Con.	2012-12-17
When Tony (Ben Affleck) lands in Tehran and trains the frightened Americans to play their parts as a Canadian film crew, Argo compares the ruses run by governments and movie studios.	2012-12-08
The whole thing is paced like a whip, and the third act may literally be the most suspenseful piece of film I've ever seen - and yes, I have seen Rear Window. Recommended without any reservation for every and any cinemagoer.	2012-12-04
A terrific supporting cast, especially the non A-list actors, make the dramatic license taken justified and redeem Affleck for miscasting himself in the hero's role.	2012-11-26
A brilliant thriller that's based on a historical incident, 'Argo' is one of the best films of 2012.	2012-11-19
A wonderfully lively and engrossing movie ...	2012-11-12
An enthralling and deliciously entertaining movie -- and a deserved triumph for its star and director.	2012-11-11
Functional.	2012-11-10
The details make for a rip-roaring story, which Affleck invests with old-school directorial elan.	2012-11-09
Ben Affleck leaps on to the A-list of directors with this relentlessly entertaining thriller, combining comedy and nerve-jangling suspense to maximum effect.	2012-11-09
If you're a nailbiter, bring gloves, because the suspense will see you reach your knuckles.	2012-11-09
Surprisingly enjoyable, given that you may have little prior commitment to this story and only mildly fancy Affleck.	2012-11-09
Affleck skilfully turns the screw of suspense, gaining added traction from an extremely convincing recreation of the setting and period.	2012-11-09
Ben Affleck's movie tells an amazing but true story set against the context of the Iranian hostage crisis.	2012-11-08
Talent borrows and genius steals, but Affleck does something in between: he mimics.	2012-11-08
It's impossible to be bored by a story this good, especially with that cast.	2012-11-08
Part of what makes this headspinning story believable is the fact that it pans out in an oddly uncomplicated way.	2012-11-08
The shaggy and bearded Ben Affleck, barely recognisable from his former self, gives a great lead performance. Understated, intense and steely-eyed, Affleck has the screen presence of legendary actor/director Clint Eastwood.	2012-11-08
Affleck the director is utterly sure-footed with an instinctive feel for characterization, tension and pacing as he builds the action towards a nail-biting climax.	2012-11-08
A dum-tight thriller demonstrating that Affleck is one of the most accomplished directors working in Hollywood today.	2012-11-07
[Affleck] once again proves, as he did in The Town, that he's a pretty good actor but a great director.	2012-11-07
Nailing the tension, the terror and the gallows humour of its story without resorting to jingoism or losing sight of its political context, Argo is a close-to-flawless thriller with a devilishly smart mouth.	2012-11-06
Better to watch it as a meta cinema commentary than a historical thriller. Either way, Argo is both smart and fun but ultimately lightweight. Star Wars fans may well cry before the credits roll.	2012-11-05
It's to Affleck's credit that he manages to knit Hollywood levity into the genuinely gripping question of whether the embassy Americans can pull this off.	2012-11-04
The Avengers does have is a solid gold structure that doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast.	2013-09-08
Smart, witty, funny, action-packed and surprisingly cathartic.	2013-08-02
The bigger and goofier it gets, the more fun it becomes.	2013-08-02
A fun light-hearted summer blockbuster that is weighed down by a forgettable villain.	2013-06-30
If you're not already a fanboy, it'll turn you into one. It is honestly the most fun I have had at the movies in a long, long time.	2013-06-23
After two-and-a-half hours of world-threatening chaos and world-saving derring-do, you leave the theater satisfied, but without so much as a single memorable image (or idea) lingering in your mind.	2013-06-20
Fast-paced superhero series sequel will be fun for fans.	2013-06-03
Joss Whedon empties everything at his reported $225 million disposal to assault the eyes, ears and intelligence with one of the stupidest comic book tales ever put to film.	2013-05-26
Whedon must balance the competing storylines and screen time of the actors. He does it nicely, injecting humour and a touch of drama into the action -- and all without so much as a Tesseract to his name. Some assembly required, and delivered.	2013-04-12
One of the ten best films of 2012.	2013-01-27
But one of the most fascinating moments in the picture occurs when Captain America, referring to Thor, notes: "There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that." Ah, monotheism versus paganism. Can they exist side by side?	2013-01-08
Whedon has delivered that rare action-packed, special-effects spectacle that is relentless in its eagerness to please and successful beyond its goal.	2013-01-04
It's Summer's Mightiest Movie. Nuff said.	2013-01-04
When all is said and done, Avengers is all sound and Nick Fury, signifying nothing.	2012-12-28
Was Marvel's ambitious dream for a shared cinematic universe truly worth it? In my opinion: Most definitely.	2012-10-02
The Avengers is one of the best superheroes movies in a long time and is likely to become a classic of the genre. You would need to really hate comic book movies not to get a kick out of this.	2012-09-27
The Star Wars of a new generation.	2012-09-26
"Marvel's The Avengers" is a visual comic book and it doesn't aspire to be anything more than that. As a film version it succeeds-one is tempted to say-MIGHTILY.	2012-09-24
It really is quite something that [Whedon] was able to take so many characters and put them into a movie where nobody gets left behind.	2012-09-14
It really is an astounding achievement - a film that juggles an unenviable number of elements; combining what we've seen before, slotting them together and then adding enough depth, action and humour to make this a remarkable standalone film.	2012-09-13
Marvel's "The Avengers" is the super-hero movie to end all super-hero movies. Why? Joss Whedon.	2012-09-10
Without Robert Downey Jr. delivering his witty quips in patented rat-a-tat-tat fashion, The Avengers would largely be a soulless shell of a movie that could be mistaken for a Michael Bay production.	2012-08-24
After years of buildup and prequels, "The Avengers" is merely average.	2012-08-22
The first great superhero team movie, and a film that captures the essence of what makes the Marvel Universe great.	2012-08-22
The filmmakers play a conservative game, not setting out to make a great movie but simply making sure not to screw it up an entire franchise.	2012-07-13
Feels like actual Marvel Comics are being injected directly into your bloodstream. It's simply jaw-dropping.	2012-07-03
While it reflects a movie culture that has traded originality for scale - one wonders if there's a shred of originality anywhere in the film - The Avengers is grand, throwaway fun.	2012-06-30
Yeah, it's all that. A tent-pole cash cow for the studio, a dream come true for fans, and treat for action aficionados, 'The Avengers' comes at you as the first true "summer movie spectacular" of the 2012 season.	2012-06-23
Wonderful blink and you'll miss them comic beats in the middle of the finale's mayhem. And what glorious mayhem!	2012-06-22
The overlong, stale experience barely raises a fast pulse, as the movie quickly stumbles into a standard film structure and doesn't even try to break free.	2012-06-21
... The movie isn't so much a work of storytelling as it is a marathon of wish-fulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts -- punches peppered with punchlines.	2012-06-15
The culmination of four distinct franchises is an exciting and entertaining product.	2012-06-13
It's the humor that's The Avengers' strength.	2012-06-01
Whedon's clear fanboy glee is irresistibly contagious to the audience, whether the heroes and villains go at it with fisticuffs or sharp, witty dialogue.	2012-05-28
Comic-book movie delivers the goods	2012-05-24
By the time the utterly routine (and decidedly endless) finale rolls around, Marvel's The Avengers has unquestionably squandered the potential of its premise and its cast...	2012-05-24
Delivers big time with everything longtime fans and newcomers alike could possibly want in a summer blockbuster that definitely surpasses the hype.	2012-05-22
This too-long adventure is a sensory overload --- complete with loud, protracted battle scenes and hunky super heroes who provide the necessary eye candy. It's also very funny, and highly entertaining.	2012-05-18
There is much humor laced throughout the film, giving it an air of not taking itself too seriously -- which is as it should be in a film of this genre.	2012-05-18
... tremendous fun ...	2012-05-17
A creative team WOW	2012-05-17
The Avengers lives up to every last ounce of hype.	2012-05-16
It's a blockbuster that manages to please with intelligence and fun. Whedon makes it look easy.	2012-05-16
It's all very smoothly done but comes without a hint of surprise or revelation.	2012-05-14
The Main Event is pretty much what you'd expect &#8210; noisy, overlong, wall-to-wall CG effects and arcane superhero lore ... Yes, it's all fairly formulaic, but on a Wow! scale never before experienced.	2012-05-12
If you only see one movie this year over and over again, it'll probably be this one.	2012-05-12
I have a feeling that this will be a comfort film for myself and many other film geeks for years to come, just like the Indiana Jones or Star Wars movies.	2012-05-12
Whedon delivers a thoroughly entertaining compilation of the best of these heroes while never hiding either his giddy love for the characters or the wry wit that has formed the bedrock of his career.	2012-05-11
The Avengers will surely rank among the best superhero movies, if not summer blockbusters, of all time.	2012-05-10
The Avengers is a fun time at the movies. That's as important as anything.	2012-05-10
Visual elements draw from a theatrical vocabulary, such as a besorrowed M overlooking gray London at a window slashed with billions of cold tears, match-cut to wounded Bond cascading over a waterfall like a spent package.	2014-04-16
It's not just a terrific Bond movie; it's a terrific movie, period.	2013-07-24
It is not the breath of fresh air that was 2006's "Casino Royale," but it is nearly as satisfying.	2013-05-23
Mendes has embraced the general super-ness of Bond and taken his inspiration from the best superhero flick of recent years: The Dark Knight.	2013-05-22
For 50 years, we've placed our stock in Bonds, but never have our investments yielded the sort of windfall 'Skyfall' delivers over two-and-a-half hours of pulsating entertainment that will leave you shaken - and stirred.	2013-05-13
One of the better bonds, but it isn't as good as Daniel Craig's first outing.	2013-03-21
Solicits swoons like the best Bonds ever did, even if Bond's dangerously close to decommission.	2013-03-18
A very British Bond, and also a very personal one.	2013-03-03
It ought to win a prize just for reconnecting with what made the franchise successful in the first place, while also repositioning the Bond films for the '10s.	2013-02-16
Sam Mendes revitalizes the James Bond franchise with a slick and action-packed entry. Daniel Craig proves yet again why he's the best Bond yet.	2013-02-13
Bond traditions haven't just been updated -- they've been intelligently modified and rethought, giving us the franchise's inherent pleasures in a new package.	2013-02-12
Skyfall proves that a long-standing series can deliver the expected fundamentals while keeping the new films fresh and unpredictable.	2013-02-04
One of the ten best films of 2012.	2013-01-27
The film serves as a trip back to the beginning of the 50-year-old cinematic legend and the promise of a golden future with Craig in the role of 007.	2013-01-04
It's been a long time since I enjoyed a Bond movie so much.	2013-01-04
What propels this grisly chapter is the characters' keen sense of agency.	2012-12-31
Skyfall epitomizes what a Bond movie should be, and its director, for once, justifiably deserves much of the credit.	2012-12-30
Skyfall isn't quite a throwback to the absurd thrills of the 007 films of old, but it does inject some fun back into the franchise.	2012-12-17
As the saying goes, you've got to shake 22 Bond films, before the 23rd is stirred to perfection. Without a doubt, this is the best James Bond movie.	2012-12-11
James Bond looks broken and weary, an embodiment of a traditional model of international spydom, the one premised on national borders, white-Western-wealthy entitlements, and excessive consumptions of alcohol, cars, and women.	2012-12-08
I have no compulsion whatsoever in declaring Skyfall, in terms of cinematography, the best looking Bond film ever ... Action movies simply don't look like this - but ... this is no ordinary action movie.	2012-12-04
Sentimental touches underscore the fun and frivolity of Bond's past while relishing the brutal landscape of the modern day super-spy.	2012-11-26
This makes the list of truly great 007 films alongside the list of Goldfinger, Thunderball, Live And Let Die, Licence To Kill, Goldeneye and Casino Royale.	2012-11-26
Worlds collide in this near-brilliant, meticulously refined 21st-century redefinition of James Bond.	2012-11-26
Sam Mendes has done a magnificent job, creating both a relevant and timeless entry into the Bond canon, while deftly adding homages to the series' past.	2012-11-25
...tough and grim but still spry ... feels like something of a rearguard action in the case of the British Empire.	2012-11-25
Sometimes the old ways are the best. This is a theme and repeated line running throughout the new James Bond film Skyfall and never has it been more true.	2012-11-23
Skyfall does what all of the best franchise entries do: it makes you want to see the next one immediately. Consider me (physically) shaken and (emotionally) stirred.	2012-11-23
Not the best Bond movie ever but a very good one; a little darker but still unsettled as to what type overall it wants to be.	2012-11-22
Too often this martini is sloppy, not smooth.	2012-11-22
This is one of the 50-year-old series' most exciting and commandingly compelling entries. Yes, James Bond is back to being James Bond.	2012-11-22
Seen against the ineffectual backdrop of 2008's Quantum of Solace, this is a return to form but it doesn't exceed Craig's impressive debut as Bond in 2006's Casino Royale.	2012-11-22
Skyfall is not, of course, ''darker'' or more serious than previous Bond films, but it's more knowing about its own conventions.	2012-11-22
Fabulous entertainment.	2012-11-22
Breathes fresh life into the genre.	2012-11-22
A lot of critics are claiming this to be the best Bond film ever made; they may well be right-to some degree. It's certainly the most poignant-which, in what is ostensibly an action film, is a feather in Mendes' cap to be sure.	2012-11-21
James Bond's 23rd official feature film gives the iconic secret agent something to stew over: an existential crisis.	2012-11-21
Suffers from unconvincing plotting, and a third act so bad it brings the roof of the whole endeavour caving in	2012-11-21
Even die-hard Sean Connery fans will have to admit there's another actor who can portray James Bond when they see 'Skyfall.'	2012-11-19
Mendes does a superb job maintaining tension - and releasing it from time to time so we can take a breath, have a laugh, sit back from the edge of our seat - as he shows how seriously the James Bond character can be taken, without breaking it	2012-11-18
Establishing a sense of urgency from the outset, the 23rd Bond film hits its tall target with a bonus back-story, character establishment and strong storyline to balance the action. As a consequence, we are offered a film that is uniquely Bond	2012-11-18
Skyfall is inconsistent, displaying Bond at its blandest and Bond at its best.	2012-11-17
Best...Bond...ever.	2012-11-16
A smashing new Bond adventure for the superspy's 50th anniversary year.	2012-11-16
Sweeping action, solid characters, spectacular scenery, a bountiful sense of cleverness, and a pitch-perfect tone of self-reference to the long line of Bond pop-culture mythology.	2012-11-16
Mendes and Co. has an astutely cunning way to keep our blood pumping every minute of the latest and, arguably, best time we've had with the enduring Bond in years.	2012-11-15
Better than the average Bond, but not the greatest.	2012-11-15
a crackerjack Bond film that cannily mixes the harder, more severe edges of the previous Craig films with a sly sense of humor	2012-11-15
The latest James Bond adventure proves, at least in my opinion, that Craig has grasped the role better than any of his predecessors, including Sean Connery.	2012-11-15
Skyfall succeeds in providing epic escapism with just the right balance of action, art-house aesthetics and melodrama.	2012-11-14
The film, much like it's heroine played by Jessica Chastain (The Help), is steely-resolved with eyes only for the task at hand.	2013-09-08
Even without getting a Hollywood makeover, the story has inherent drama, suspense, and thrills, which Bigelow lets arise naturally.	2013-07-13
A historical timeline, a pulsating thriller, a moving character study and a true-life violent revenge story, all in one, told in a sweating, oppressive, strangling fashion.	2013-06-23
If you like World War II films, you'll enjoy this.	2013-06-13
Zero Dark Thirty is truly one of the best films of 2012. In my list, it is the best...	2013-06-06
"Zero Dark Thirty" shows guts in taking on loaded subject matter and filmmaking confidence and skill in not telling us how we should feel about it.	2013-05-28
It provides a much needed catharsis for what was done to nearly 3,000 innocent Americans at the behest of a mass-murdering religious zealot.	2013-05-13
...a somber, black-winged benediction for what we might count as a lost decade.	2013-04-27
Unsettling and unforgettable...challenges the justifications of war's ugly atrocities, without resorting to jingoistic platitudes.	2013-04-23
a brilliant high tech treatment of the subject and the classified nature of the disclosures	2013-04-14
A film of infectious urgency, questionable accuracy, murky morality and undeniable emotional and intellectual power	2013-04-08
Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty is a grueling masterpiece that captures the hunt for bin Laden with a daunting amount of realism and efficiency.	2013-03-31
The direction by Kathryn Bigelow, who won Oscars for Best Film and Best Director in her previous film "The Hurt Locker," is fierce and focused...	2013-03-23
Indulges Cheneyian fantasies complete with the bad-movie scene of the prisoner's defiance: "You're just a garbage man in the corporation," shouts the Arab who needs a lesson in manners from the Ph.D. (in torture?) who is racking him.	2013-03-19
Bigelow tells the story very well, very efficiently, but doesn't really say much about it, which is ironic given the response to the film in some quarters.	2013-03-17
Kathryn Bigelow takes the procedural model and brushes away every unnecessary detail, leaving behind a heavy, blunt object of a film that is also hugely watchable, engrossing and, best of all... highly suspenseful.	2013-03-14
Rotten Tomatoes notes that I agree with Tomatometer critics 80 percent of the time, but this is one of those times I have to part ways with them.	2013-03-14
Bigelow has directed excellent movies before, but this deserves to be remembered as the film that established her as a master.	2013-03-13
You can't deny that what Zero Dark Thirty sets out to do, it does excellently.	2013-02-26
An exhilarating and compelling historical document worthy of praise.	2013-02-23
Bigelow's latest proves a rewarding piece of filmmaking, one that, in its best moments at least, is as gripping and as troubling as anything the director's ever made.	2013-02-19
Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal shape history -- those breaks, big and small, that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden -- into one of the finest fact-based thrillers since "All the President's Men."	2013-02-16
A ripping revenge yarn.	2013-02-15
Purely as cinematic exercise, Zero Dark Thirty is an exhilarating piece of work. But, beyond its for-the-times subject matter, the work does not linger whatsoever.	2013-02-13
Zero Dark Thirty is interesting as opposed to enjoyable, intriguing as opposed to entertaining, and certainly less memorable than The Hurt Locker.	2013-02-10
It's quite remarkable how Bigelow and Boal managed to take 12 years of information (including a conclusion that everyone knows) and packaged it into a coherent, intimate and intense movie.	2013-02-10
We know the ending, yet remain mesmerized by familiar details, filmed with a harrowing sense of urgency. It's as close to being in the White House situation room that night, watching a closed-circuit broadcast, as anyone could expect.	2013-02-09
The second half of the film IS the film.	2013-02-09
What's striking is the absence of triumphalism -- Bigelow doesn't shy away from showing the victims shot down in cold blood in the compound -- and we come away with the overwhelming sense that this has been a grim, dark episode in our history.	2013-02-05
Whereas Locker was less about war than what it is to have a death wish, ZDT is less about the suspenseful true-life search for Osama bin Laden than the red tape one woman must wade through to prove that a mean old bastard is living in suburban Pakistan.	2013-02-04
Bigelow's great achievement is stripping down the action from the exaggerated theatrics in movies and television shows so the missions feel no less exciting and immediate.	2013-02-04
One of the finest movies of the year is a thriller about the tracking and, finally, slaying of Osama bin Laden.	2013-02-02
There is no Team America-style, flag-waving bravado behind this story - it is quite the opposite.	2013-02-02
Bigelow has created the best film of 2012.	2013-02-01
"Zero Dark Thirty" is less a celebration how terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden was found and killed than an engrossing examination of why it took a decade to deal with him.	2013-02-01
One of the year's best	2013-02-01
Following on from the great acclaim of The Hurt Locker, Bigalow's shaky cam and tough talking characters once again take us to the dark side of modern warfare.	2013-01-31
In the absence of cinematic grandeur and didacticism, we're left as empty and as lost as Chastain's agent as she boards a symbolically empty plane for an uncertain future. Just what are we to think of the so-called War on Terror?	2013-01-31
The viewer needs to stay sharp to stay on top of the details of the labyrinthine search, but Bigelow tackles the complex story with the same muscular urgency and incisive intelligence that won her an Oscar for The Hurt Locker.	2013-01-28
Exhilarating cinema that makes you want to forget all the questionable issues of representation that have come before it.	2013-01-28
This is a fascinating film, and Chastain's wonderful performance has something in it of the tragic sense of life.	2013-01-27
So overwhelming is the momentum that it proves possible to live with the intelligence that the protagonist is complicit in ground-level fascism.	2013-01-25
Blistering writing, directing and acting hold us firmly in our seats as this procedural drama snakes its way to a riveting action finale	2013-01-25
Terrifically good, propulsive film-making ...	2013-01-25
Remarkable and engaging piece of filmmaking considering the outcome of the story is well known. A sign of the times we live in and the processes put in place to wrangle the people that choose to live outside the realm of civility	2013-01-24
Not what you'd call crowd-pleasing, this is fascinating - if occasionally harrowing - in its realistic depiction of the intricacies of CIA operations.	2013-01-24
Against all the odds, Kathryn Bigelow's powerful story of the hunt is a taut and searing action thriller that keeps you gripped.	2013-01-24
A silly, at times despicable film that never remotely deserved an Oscar nomination. Compared with this, Team America: World Police was a think piece.	2013-01-24
We get all imaginable views of the witchy pentacle that is covert US military politics.	2013-01-24
It haunts and lingers long after the lights go up.	2013-01-24
Endlessly subjective to the kids' fantasy of the world around them, a memory in mind compacted from impressions half-glimpsed, Anderson confects and even perfects a headlong heaven's-to-Etsy esthetic, in hothouse glory.	2014-04-14
Anderson's woodsy thought process... elicits a thorough batch of the rainy summer daydreams where most grand childhood adventures and romances are so often had: in heads and hearts, if not in flesh.	2013-08-03
Wes Anderson remains trapped in the aquarium of his own imagination.	2013-08-03
All the grounding you need comes from the performances of Hayward and Gilman as the young runaways. They seem to have internalized Anderson's wonky worldview completely.	2013-08-03
It's Wes Anderson's dollhouse as a home for wayward boys. Turns out, it's a safe place for adults to hide as well.	2013-06-23
The film is frequently funny, always elegant (or mock-elegant), and something that would make Humbert Humbert laugh all the way to his asylum.	2013-06-17
Anderson delivers a magnificent blend of artistry, humor and emotional resonance.	2013-05-24
To date my favorite Wes Anderson and I don't characterize myself as an Anderson fan.	2013-03-21
It's doubtful this will win over any outright Anderson sceptics, but ... this is an exciting reaffirmation of talent.	2013-03-04
Wes Anderson's darkest movie yet retains his whimsical sense of humour and Fantastic Mr Fox-styled absurdity.	2013-03-04
One of the ten best films of 2012.	2013-01-27
At its heart, Moonrise Kingdom is a sweet and surprising love story with a healthy twist of typically warped humour.	2013-01-08
The Houston native and University of Texas graduate beautifully blends humor and pathos to create what's bound to be one of the best movies of the year.	2013-01-04
People who enjoy being immersed in his singular vision won't be disappointed at all.	2013-01-04
Anderson's manner becomes a second skin and essential to the script, making Moonrise Kingdom a most comfortable way to watch matters uncomfortable.	2012-12-31
Easily among the best of [Anderson's] works, it's a technically marvelous film with spot-on performances, a gorgeously realized score, and impeccable production design.	2012-12-28
In the summer of big, expensive superhero flicks, Moonrise Kingdom evokes awe, wonder and the magic of escapism in a much smaller and more precious way.	2012-12-17
Another quirky comedy from Wes Anderson who is an acquired taste I have not acquired.	2012-12-12
a farce of whimsical philosophical import	2012-11-25
It's like a picturesque, ride down a long countryside road in autumn bursting with wonderful imagery; richly developed characters complimented by an excellent score that quickly brings you into this small in scope, but big on brilliance effort.	2012-11-24
Films that can charm kids and adults in equal measure are rare. This is one of them.	2012-11-21
So precise it could be alien, so raw and aching it has to be human. Competes with the best of Anderson. A film to be celebrated.	2012-11-05
This is the best film I've seen so far this year.	2012-10-23
With its deadpan dialogue and damaged characters, Moonrise Kingdom casts a unique and charming spell and is surprisingly hopeful.	2012-10-21
Moonrise Kingdom remains - for the most part - a gem of a film, and clear indication that Wes Anderson is only getting better with age.	2012-10-02
If you can fully get on Anderson's wavelength you may find this film transportive. I, however, thought it was far too quaint.	2012-09-27
How Wes Anderson stitches it all together is far beyond the reach of most filmmakers. His approach is artful without pretension, gorgeous and composed without feeling forced, charming and innocent but never trite.	2012-09-26
Moonrise Kingdom is a totally charming and enchanting piece of work from director Wes Anderson, who along with a great cast provide one of the delights of the year.	2012-09-15
Moonrise Kingdom is enchanting and warm like fond memories of your first love; but with a self-awareness that sees the hilarity in the eccentrics that abound.	2012-09-13
Wes Anderson's refreshingly original "Moonrise Kingdom" is an unconventional children's adventure for adults, filled with with striking colors, textures and humor, and teeming with childhood innocence.	2012-09-10
...it reminds us of the way we (mis)apprehended the world when we were children, the way we strained to hear the adults in conference, the way we looked for clues in their manner and fastened our attention on ... random or inconsequential details.	2012-09-10
The reputation of Wes Anderson as one of America's most consistently over-rated directors gets another boost with his latest exercise in stylistic posturing and forced whimsy.	2012-09-07
The divide between childhood and adolescence as a nature stroll	2012-09-04
So many scenes will leave you with raised eyebrows and a wry smile.	2012-08-30
The most Wes Anderson-ish film Wes Anderson has ever made, 'Moonrise Kingdom' won't convert any naysayers to the cause, but fans of his work will have a ball.	2012-08-30
Moonrise Kingdom, which the director wrote with regular collaborator Roman Coppola, feels like his most emotionally honest work since his 1998 breakthrough, Rushmore.	2012-08-30
It's not my favourite Wes Anderson film but I do like it very much.	2012-08-30
His singular take on young love on the run from any sort of authority has moments of sheer oddness, but it's all of a piece with his other work and you are either an Anderson fan or you're not.	2012-08-30
There are many echoes of Anderson's earlier films, particularly Rushmore and Tenenbaums. He's an unapologetic romantic and Moonrise Kingdom is a study in wish-fulfillment.	2012-08-30
Let the haters hate, but Anderson continues to build a distinctive filmography on par with any of his contemporaries.	2012-08-30
Most will happily accept, and be truly enraptured by what unfolds.	2012-08-30
Moonrise Kingdom is an extremely sweet and heartfelt portrayal of young love and how such love inspires the lives of others who encounter it.	2012-08-29
A hit of nostalgia in 50 shades of brown	2012-08-27
Around the time of his disappointing and detached The Life Aquatic, I wondered if Wes could still tell real stories. He can. His way. That is all we can ever ask of a filmmaker.	2012-08-27
A complex set of cinematic pleasures, ranging from its vibrant, eccentric visual presentation to its deadpan humour and superb performances. Oh, and the music!	2012-08-26
The brush strokes are uniquely Anderson	2012-08-26
It's a collection of cockeyed ideas compressed into a narrative that's utterly devoid of any actual attachment.	2012-08-24
As detached as the filmmaking sometimes appears, I daresay you can feel something pure coming off of the screen. Moonrise Kingdom is a stellar film.	2012-08-22
Summer lovin' just got a whole more stylish thanks to Wes Anderson.	2012-08-05
Quirky, random, and surprisingly endearing for a Wes Anderson film--likely his best.	2012-07-26
This is the real deal, folks - intelligent, humorous, exciting entertainment that happens to be sci-fi but is by no means limited to that genre's target audience in terms of appeal.	2013-07-17
This is a wildly entertaining film that isn't content with science and cinematic tricks. It desires, and achieves, much more.	2013-06-23
I found myself dreaming of the days when Willis would take a rest from Die Hard-ing to do character cameos of unexpected depth and pathos: Pulp Fiction, Nobody's Fool, and a few others. Now he clings to stoic longevity, and shoots people.	2013-06-14
The ending is both daring and logical, two rarities in modern sci-fi.	2013-05-26
With a heady script, stunning performances and fist-pumping action, LOOPER is the most enjoyable combination of immensely watchable yet poignant, even cerebral.	2013-04-03
If it weren't for its gaping plot holes, this could be one of this century's best science fiction features.	2013-03-21
A fresh, intelligent and action-packed addition to the time-travel anthology.	2013-03-03
Not quite the time travel story science fiction fans were hoping for, alas.	2013-01-21
Yes, it's a B movie sci-fi thriller, but not many prestige pictures have this much going on underneath the surface.	2013-01-04
[Looper] may be the best sci-fi thriller to hit the theaters since 1995's Twelve Monkeys.	2013-01-04
That first hour cooks. And the second hour brings Emily Blunt into the story, which is a fine thing for any second half to offer.	2013-01-04
Is it derivative? Not really; just a reminder that cinema, like history, is on a continuous loop, forever repeating itself.	2013-01-04
If the whole thing leaves you rubbing your temples, just a bit... well, this headache's sort of worth it.	2013-01-04
Despite its confusing logic and ornate storyline, Looper still grabs the audience with the raw emotional storyline on the farm and the constant popping back and forth in time. It's a head-scratching ride, but a fun one nonetheless.	2013-01-04
Call it the coolest, most complex sci-fi of 2012 and the best movie of its kind since "Inception." Pow! What a ride!	2013-01-01
Accessible to a general audience while still having moments that will warm any film geek's heart, this is the kind of genre film that elevates the form.	2012-12-28
The movie is morally murky, to put it lightly, and that's a bit refreshing; we're made to think about why we want the protagonists to achieve their goals.	2012-12-17
Intelligent, extremely imaginative, visually stunning and constantly surprising, this is filmmaking of the highest order from Rian Johnson.	2012-12-04
Looper is among the cleverest, most skillfully crafted and entertaining sci-fi thrillers of the past 20 years.	2012-11-02
The smartest, most stylish and most outright entertaining science-fiction film of the year.	2012-10-30
A thought-provoking, heart-pounding take on the applications and ethics of time travel which, oddly enough, doubles up as a lesson in the importance of good parenting.	2012-10-30
This is one of those rare genre movies (like the original TERMINATOR) that reminds us that Sci-Fi can be smart. It's much more than just a bunch of special effects and explosions. It's what all movies should aspire to be.	2012-10-26
While it sometimes feels like it's trying to do much, Looper manages to be a creditable and exciting sci-fi flick that homages the past while carving out a unique identity.	2012-10-24
Much as he did in Brick, Johnson creates a carefully drawn world in Looper that exists by its own particular set of rules.	2012-10-19
... has an irresistible energy and a don't-give-a-damn unpredictability ...	2012-10-18
Beautifully crafted, acted and written.	2012-10-17
Anchors high-concept thrills and captivating ideas in a world of challenging morality and intricate personal consequences.	2012-10-16
Truly imaginative but all the twists and turns make the overall film difficult to follow. Plus Gordon-Levitt has not reached leading man status yet.	2012-10-10
Kind of a reverse-"Terminator" without any of James Cameron's wit (or wisdom),	2012-10-09
An endlessly creative mind-blowing film that captures everything right about the movie going experience. Johnson conjures up the most imaginative action/science fiction film since 'Inception.'	2012-10-09
Part science fiction, part mob movie, and with a nice infusion of dark comedy at just the right moments, Looper is Johnson's best movie yet, and manages to be hugely entertaining, affecting, and thought-provoking.	2012-10-09
takes us far beyond the film's high-concept premise into the kind of emotional terrain that too often escapes even the best genre filmmakers	2012-10-09
Doesn't quite reach the heights of the lofty ideals that it so ardently seeks to expound, but makes up for this with the sheer thrill of the journey Rian Johnson takes us on.	2012-10-08
Ingenious with a fine performance by Emily Blunt, but far too much cold-blooded violence.	2012-10-06
Engaging, exciting, and successfully cross-breeding elements of Terminator and even Pet Sematary, Looper is a solid work of palatable science-fiction.	2012-10-06
Looper's super. An action-thriller that bothers to have a brain.	2012-10-06
Looper may not take us back to the future as satisfyingly as Robert Zemeckis' Marty McFly trilogy or James Cameron's Terminator franchise, but writer-director Rian Johnson does enough right to all but guarantee that he has a future cult film on the books.	2012-10-06
The best time travel films play on emotion rather than logic, and once Looper realises this and drops all the tail-chasing about how time travel works it settles into the engrossing action/drama about destiny it should have been from the get go.	2012-10-05
Has more depth, smarts, and heart than the usual sci-fi bluster.	2012-10-05
A just about brilliant sci-fi crime-drama-thriller mostly set in the years 2044 and 2074. Rian Johnson is a rare director who creates entertainment with depth.	2012-10-05
The key to enjoying the gruesome violence mixed with a healthy potion of emotional depth rarely found in this genre is to not dwell on the fiction in the science.	2012-10-05
Sometimes time travel is just used a cheap device in movies to make them seem different; this is not one of those films. It's genuinely unique and fresh.	2012-10-05
Very entertaining on many, many levels.	2012-10-04
The best kind of light entertainment that expects you to be just as intelligent as it is.	2012-10-04
It's complex enough that sci-fi fans can dig deeper over multiple viewings, but thrilling enough that casual viewers can take it all in with one watch.	2012-10-04
...an above-average sci-fi tale.	2012-10-04
Rian Johnson makes a loud, dark, highly stylized film that looks good but whose ideas do not really bear close examination.	2012-10-03
Time travel makes sense in Looper because writer-director Rian Johnson keeps it on a short leash, not requiring enough manufactured logic to trip over later.	2012-10-03
I don't know where you guys found that kid... Was it the same lab where they grew the Fannings?	2012-10-03
Besides a challenging time-travel premise, a dark sense of humor, and some thrilling action scenes, Looper has the kind emotional weight that you wouldn't expect.	2012-10-02
Ono may be the center of this universe, but the real star of the film is the sushi, and the exquisite yet frustrating beauty with which the camera has captured it.	2013-06-17
Gelb also provides an education on the different kinds of sushi, the purveyors of premium fish and rice, and overfishing. But it's his lyrical, lovingly photographed scenes of preparation that elevates the documentary to a work of art.	2013-04-21
Subtitled docu about sushi chef inspires and enlightens.	2013-03-22
You may not dream of sushi, but don't watch this on an empty stomach.	2013-02-04
Taking a minimalistic approach that matches his subject matter, documentary filmmaker Gelb delves into one of the most acclaimed kitchens in the world: the tiny Tokyo sushi bar run by 85-year-old Jiro Ono, the oldest chef to earn three Michelin stars.	2013-01-15
I left the cinema wanting to meet the man and eat his food.	2013-01-13
David Gelb's affectionate documentary ...	2013-01-11
A beautiful ode to an artisan and his culture.	2013-01-10
Jiro Ono's exacting standards have earned him three Michelin stars, but it's his taciturn nature that spices and sours this documentary.	2013-01-10
The themes of age and appalling loss give the film a freakishly affecting lyricism.	2013-01-10
Jiro Dreams of Sushi sets a drool-flecked new standard in food porn, and makes the moanings and gruntings of Nigella Lawson look softcore by comparison.	2013-01-10
The exquisite nigiri slices gleam with freshness, and you do learn about the component parts to the perfect serving of sea eel or gizzard shad.	2013-01-08
It's torture to watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi -- if you are on an empty stomach.	2013-01-07
The end result isn't just one of the best films of 2012, documentary or fiction, but a movie worthy of Jiro himself.	2013-01-07
Treating his seafood substantially better than Oldboy, Jiro is a miracle of perfectionism married to expertise. The same can said for Gelb's loving documentary.	2013-01-07
It does not try to make any broad claims about it subject beyond simply observing, this is what he does, this is why it matters, and this is his legacy.	2012-12-17
It's a simple tale, but one to savour.	2012-12-17
I never cared for sushi, but I have to admit that seeing the documentary film, 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' makes me want to try the incomparable and expensive sushi at Jiro's place.	2012-12-04
The no-nonsense documentary about a compulsive sushi chef wet my appetite even though I never liked sushi.	2012-11-26
If the ultimate goal of a documentary is to drop you into a location and make you feel it as if you were actually there, consider this the most scrumptious trip to Tokyo you'll ever take.	2012-08-24
If the wardrobe to Narnia led to a restaurant full of world-class sushi, "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" would be the exquisitely shot documentary that filmed your journey.	2012-08-01
A movie as elegant, spare and tantalizing as its subject.	2012-07-30
Like the food on display in beautiful close-ups, the film is a sleek reminder that simple can be fulfilling, and maybe even brilliant.	2012-07-26
delves deep into the qualities of dedication and perfectionism	2012-06-01
The movie functions well as high-end food porn, but it's also an insightful character study of the single-minded Jiro.	2012-05-24
It's an interesting exploration of a particular aspect of Japanese culture, which is fathers and sons working together. It's a very likeable film, and sometimes, that's enough. If you're a Japanophile or a sushi nut, you'll likely be in heaven.	2012-05-22
Even after you've eaten your fill, Gelb's film is memorable not just as a foodie paradise, but as a lovely, insightful portrait of a man in a lifelong search for perfection.	2012-05-16
Watching Jiro work with the decades of experience on his side is like watching a master painter adding strokes to a masterpiece.	2012-05-14
I can imagine that if you are a sushi lover, then you'll be drooling over the delicious looking scenery, and it maybe even convince you to make a trip to Japan just to try some of the food.	2012-05-12
The film similarly guides us smoothly from opening credits to closing without complaint or concern, and before you know it, you've dreamily submitted to 80 minutes of raw fish preparation.	2012-05-06
If you ever wondered what is the Art of Sushi, David Gelb's intriguing portrait opens up a whole new world, in which we learn about simplicity, balance and what defines 'deliciousness'	2012-05-06
The centerpiece is a gorgeously photographed sequence showing a dinner at Jiro's restaurant, a "concerto" of the many courses (all sushi, no appetizers) that will make any foodie's mouth water.	2012-05-04
Thoughtful, gentle and wonderfully restrained, David Gelb's brief documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a portrait of an artist in full flower, a master who has achieved a species of perfection.	2012-04-29
Since few (if any) of us will ever be able to actually taste sushi chef Jiro Ono's cuisine -- minimum cost per person to dine there is roughly $300 -- we'll have to console ourselves with the visual bliss of this entertaining documentary.	2012-04-27
As artful as it is appetizing.	2012-04-27
The parade of dishes is like one note after another in a symphony meant to be appreciated by all the senses.	2012-04-26
By the time this graceful film is over you understand why Japan has declared the bald, bespectacled Jiro a national treasure. Even if you've never tasted sushi, the man's singleness of purpose will inspire you.	2012-04-20
Gelb apparently understood that his subject was itself so taking that he wouldn't need filmic embellishments to keep his viewers alert.	2012-04-20
Yes, it will make you hungry, but it also supplies an understanding of skill and care that's largely lost in today's mechanical world. It's a simple story, yet one with fascinating levels of behavior and expertise to examine.	2012-04-19
Obsessive, we were saying? Oh my, yes, and that's what makes the film so compelling.	2012-04-19
As simple and elegant as Jiro's preparations, "Sushi" alternates between the master musing on his cooking philosophy (good food, he says, makes him feel "victorious") and footage of the three chefs at work in their minuscule kitchen.	2012-04-19
You don't have to like sushi to appreciate a master	2012-04-15
This documentary strikes a balance between storytelling and food porn that's hard to come by in foodie flicks. Like a proper sushi meal, "Jiro" left me feeling sated, not stuffed.	2012-04-12
Savory documentary, which is especially appetizing for foodies.	2012-04-11
Any documentary that can make sushi interesting for 90 minutes clearly does something right.	2012-04-10
As a tribute to the art of preparing traditional Japanese cuisine it could hardly be bettered. But it's arguably even more fascinating as a portrait of one man's single-minded devotion to his craft and its effect on the next generation.	2012-04-07
Jiro Ono makes sushi Dreams come true	2012-04-06
The most interesting moments, however, belong not to the chef but to those who labor in his shadow.	2012-04-06
As exhausting as Jiro may be, he's also inspiring.	2012-04-06
I can't recall being this hungry exiting a theater.	2012-04-05
It all adds up to not just a document of the time but a blueprint for today's activists.	2014-02-07
A compellingly watchable portrait of a battle fought under that most memorable rallying cry: "Silence = Death". Bravo.	2013-11-11
I don't doubt that anyone who has had a brush with AIDS, lost a friend or even a hero like Queen's Freddie Mercury, will find what is already a socially curious, medically fascinating and politically charged film an unmissably emotional experience.	2013-11-08
This inspirational, unexpectedly hilarious film is a patchwork of archival footage that takes us up to the present day.	2013-11-08
Nominated for the Oscar, this documentary is one of the most involving and moving films you'll see all year. At its core this is a movie about how a decent society should behave, even to the point of helping people who hurt themselves.	2013-11-08
This documentary by David France persuasively argues that one of the greatest grassroots activist campaigns of modern times was the Act Up movement ...	2013-11-07
David France's documentary about the 1980s/90s American gay community and its leading role in discovering "combination therapy" - the anti-HIV magic bullet - will be inspiring among audiences from the G20.	2013-11-07
Well-made and featuring an astonishing amount of on-the-scene archive footage, this is a powerfully emotional and hugely inspirational documentary that demands to be seen.	2013-11-07
This raw and passionate AIDS treatment doc suffers from a simple lack of focus.	2013-11-07
It's no whitewash: important activists from the era admit how much time was lost through internecine squabbling, as well as the struggles they faced against the pitiless anti-gay rhetoric of their political opponents.	2013-11-07
It can't be long before we see the Hollywood version.	2013-11-05
A moving treatment of a deeply personal subject (France's own partner died of an AIDS-related illness in 1992), and an enthralling depiction of a seriously fired-up popular movement.	2013-11-04
An important, moving doc about how LGBT activism taught a community to shun silence.	2013-11-01
David France has made an absorbing film to document that moment of immense implosion, called How to Survive a Plague.	2013-06-17
An indispensable and moving piece of filmmaking.	2013-02-22
[A] glorious ode to the supposition that a small group of committed people can change the world...	2013-02-21
As this stirring, scrupulous doc reveals, the members of ACT UP fused the fervor of revolutionaries, the tenacity of trial lawyers, and the rage of the dispossessed to change the very shape of the epidemic.	2013-01-07
Plague offers an instructive lesson for Occupy-era rabble-rousers: Only when coupled with a knowledge base will your sound and fury signify anything.	2013-01-07
From a terrible epidemic comes a beautiful documentary.	2013-01-07
The film is a tribute to political activism and the power of people to change the world.	2013-01-01
One of the most powerful, fascinating and saddest documentaries of the last several years.	2012-12-28
What making a difference is really all about!	2012-12-16
A cinematically sophisticated documentary that actually finds a way to be an intelligent and admirable work of art in addition to its more overt sociological implications.	2012-12-13
A brilliant blueprint on how to spark a revolution. The activists who were highlighted in this film are American heroes to us all - gay, straight, black, white, male or female.	2012-12-07
Compelling, important and inspiring documentary about the fight against AIDS.	2012-11-28
Beautifully inspiring and, obviously, also a great cautionary tale.	2012-11-11
A raw history, often cluttered and sometimes repetitive but, when strategies fail along with immune systems, deeply affecting.	2012-11-02
Presents a valuable template for how grassroots activism can temper societal prejudice and challenge governmental indifference in the face of a mysterious and remorseless killer.	2012-11-01
A riveting look at LGBT protesters during the AIDS crisis - and an object lesson that if the revolution is going to be televised, it's good to have the revolutionaries holding the cameras.	2012-10-19
This is a moving documentary, as hopeful as it is tragic.	2012-10-19
A serious, moving and sometimes astonishingly well-organized documentary about the history of AIDS activism.	2012-10-18
[A] powerful, messy and tremendously moving documentary ...	2012-10-18
The title doesn't necessarily convey this, but "How to Survive a Plague" is an inspiring and hopeful documentary.	2012-10-18
"How to Survive a Plague" captures a saddening, maddening era that seems like far too many lifetimes ago.	2012-10-12
It can feel inchoate, dropping the viewer in the middle of events without much context, and it exacts an emotional toll. But its raw quality also makes it compelling viewing.	2012-10-11
[An] unflinching look at the activists' mistakes and acheivements, their regrets, their very solemn pride at a victory attained at so high a cost.	2012-10-11
Plague isn't the history of a disease so much as the history of a movement, and a portrait of those who refused to suffer passively.	2012-10-04
Ultimately, the story presented by the former reporter for Boston's defunct Gay Community News is one of hope.	2012-10-02
Moving and essential.	2012-10-01
At once a fascinating history and a compelling call to action.	2012-09-28
France and his crew have sculpted years of old broadcast-news stories and home videos into a narrative that is impressionistic in its scope but coherent in its feeling.	2012-09-27
This amazingly well-done, admirably dry-eyed documentary about a true human victory over what was once a universal death sentence might well be the year's finest.	2012-09-24
One of the most important documentaries in years or decades ...	2012-09-22
... compelling as a recent historical document, but also has contemporary resonance in its depiction of the influence of activism on social causes.	2012-09-21
Mostly the film toggles between two emotions - the high of watching brave people go to war, and the low of seeing so many of them fall, as entire communities are destroyed.	2012-09-21
France, drawing on a wealth of video footage from inside the organization, turns that decade of rage, despair, and tenacity into an inspiring tale of effective political action.	2012-09-21
The film puts us right in the moment of the height of the crisis better than any documentary ever has.	2012-09-21
A powerful reminder of the ability of committed men and women to agitate, organize and create real change in the world.	2012-09-21
Filmmaker David France...methodically reconstructs the critical period in the fight against AIDS from 1987 to 1995. (It) emerges as the better documentary (than this year's "United in Anger") if only due to its slightly more comprehensive perspective.	2012-09-21
A heart-wrenching portrait of one of the saddest, most heroic chapters in American history.	2012-09-21
Guaranteed to have you reaching for the Kleenex.	2013-06-02
Falardeau had the good fortune to work with a powerfully effective ensemble cast, and Martin Leon's minimalist ambient score helps set the mood for a satisfying story about the healing effect brief encounters can have on emotional scars.	2013-04-21
While it may not stand out from similar movies, Monsieur Lazhar is a sweet film with a simple story and remains engaging thanks in large part to Mohamed Fellag's charming performance.	2013-01-15
Philippe Falardeau's direction is a model of the notion that less is more, and this film is a treat well worth savoring.	2013-01-07
This is cinema at its most impactful.	2012-11-22
By the time you realise how invested you are in this tale it is too late: Monsieur Lazhar has you. I consider myself a cinematic Chuck Norris, but this film had me blubbering like a baby.	2012-09-27
While "Monsieur Lazhar" is a decent film, I wish it would have done more to stand out from other similar films.	2012-09-16
The film understands the complex bond between teachers and students, and how the classroom is a sacred space they share for a short time before moving on.	2012-09-12
Thankfully, the impressive cast of child actors actually behave like children, not like miniature adults.	2012-09-07
Monsieur Lazhar is a film to cherish.	2012-09-06
Monsieur Lazhar never pretends to be anything but a grown-up fable, and it's a captivating one.	2012-09-06
Phillipe Falardeau, who adapted the play into a screenplay, can't entirely paper over a few niggling loose ends, but overall this disturbing film is very effective indeed.	2012-09-06
Lazhar is something of a puzzle, and much of the pleasure of Philippe Falardeau's film lies in the gradual unfolding of his reserved yet impulsive personality.	2012-09-06
Very few films offer a moral grandeur, as well as a political foundation; very few films have such poised and brilliant performances from unknown actors.	2012-09-06
Monsieur Lazhar is a film that focuses on humanity when at its most vulnerable, with the film itself a warm embrace that will evoke tears of joy.	2012-09-06
Beautifully performed by all the actors, not least the youngsters	2012-09-01
The fact that both teacher and students are in need of protection adds greatly to the poignancy and Falardeau delivers an emotionally rich film filled with nuance, grace and subtlety	2012-09-01
Under Falardeau's inconspicuous lens, life plays out with rare authenticity; not just its tragedies, but its triumphs, its mishaps and its incidental interludes	2012-07-05
In Monsieur Lazhar, education can prevail over its literal restrictions. Teachers may make mistakes, but the good ones emphasize independence and intelligence. And interpretation. They serve inquisitiveness, not inquisition.	2012-07-05
Falardeau's adaptation of fellow Quebecois Evelyne de la Cheneliere's play honours the power of the written word (a motif reinforced throughout the film), and expands on its stage origins via remarkably-assured cinematic touches.	2012-06-07
Falardeau dances delicately along the razor's edge of the familiar and the conventional. But he does so with tact and taste and just the right blend of tension and relief.	2012-06-07
This moving film features exquisite performances by Fellag and a stunning ensemble of child actors. The movie also gets high marks in cinematography, sound, original musical score and editing.	2012-06-01
Although it raises timeless questions about life and loss, and timely ones about mentorship and multiculturalism, "Monsieur Lazhar" would rather teach than preach.	2012-06-01
... the perfect school drama for people who hate the Hollywood version of the genre, but are open to simple and moving stories about people doing the best they can in a world that doesn't always seem to encourage that approach.	2012-05-31
A humanistic story about how tragedy has different effects on people.	2012-05-30
a naturalistic ensemble drama about the possibilities - and the limitations - of the teacher-pupil relationship ... probably too low-key for mainstream multiplex tastes, Monsieur Lazhar is a temperate, generous and deeply affecting experience.	2012-05-28
As the teacher, Fellag suggests Robert Downey Jr. channeling a quietly reflective Robert De Niro.	2012-05-24
A gentle film can still be searing in its effect on an audience, something that "Monsieur Lazhar" proves emphatically.	2012-05-24
This is a good movie about teaching, but more importantly, a good movie about the loss of a loved one and how to cope with death.	2012-05-12
With a few folds, this story could have made a script for John Barrymore, like Topaze, or for Chaplin.	2012-05-11
There's a lighthearted inspiration infused throughout Monsieur Lazhar that makes it also touching, but never maudlin.	2012-05-11
Everything about the film sets exactly the right tone, from the unforced and winning performances by the main children to the wintry cinematography to Fellag's quietly rueful performance.	2012-05-10
The rare sort of movie that chooses not to focus on the dramatic, pivotal moments that happen in life, but what comes after.	2012-05-10
One of the most touching films of the year. A brilliant tragedy that transcends boundaries of age, country, race, religion and gender.	2012-05-10
tender and sincere, frequently striking a fine balance between the dictates of the "inspirational teacher" genre and a more mundane kind of realism that tamps down easy sentimentality and strives for something more organic and genuine	2012-05-10
Takes the fairly dreadful 'teacher who makes a difference' sub-genre and puts an interesting new spin on it that gives it the allure of something fresh.	2012-05-09
Some teachers will learn from it. All teachers will find it a reaffirmation of their vocation.	2012-05-05
Impressively directed and superbly written, this is an emotionally engaging, deservedly Oscar-nominated drama with a terrific central performance from Mohamed Said Fellag.	2012-05-05
Fans of Nicolas Philibert's immaculate chronicle of the learning curve, Etre et Avoir, are sure to appreciate the warm lessons of this award-winning Canadian film.	2012-05-04
Monsieur Lazhar remains tight-lipped about his private life, but the audience comes to learn about the great human loss and danger of deportation that clouds his life.	2012-05-04
Works awfully well, managing to be sweet and distinctly easy without feeling the need to talk down to the viewer at the same time.	2012-05-03
Eloquent drama about contemporary issues like immigration, education, integration and the propriety of physical contact with students.	2012-05-03
Only the most obstreperous delinquent could fail to be charmed by Monsieur Lazhar, in which an Algerian refugee plays ramshackle Mary Poppins to the kids at a Montreal primary.	2012-05-03
The film invites comparison with Laurent Cantet's 2008 film The Class, which makes it look tame by comparison, but also Dead Poets Society, which makes it look tough.	2012-05-03
Monsieur Lazhar becomes a deeply affecting film not for pathos but for the way sadness is conveyed so subtly. It's a small triumph of restrained compassion, coaxing throat lumps rather than jerking tears.	2012-05-03
Canadian filmmaker Philippe Falardeau's warm, tidy character study [is] gratifying.	2012-05-03
Despite its independent credentials, it feels like a softened remake of a rawer, more compelling story.	2012-05-03
A timely examination of violence in our society through the eyes of those who can't control it.	2012-05-03
Broaching tough material in a tactful, sensitive manner, Monsieur Lazhar is a potent, stirring gem of Canadian cinema.	2012-05-02
You could almost describe 'Monsieur Lazhar' as a morality tale, but it's more thought-provoking than debate-provoking.	2012-05-01
If this is not a film, by all means let us have many more such not-a-films.	2013-11-05
Doesn't follow the conventions of usual romance comedies.	2011-05-26

The Sessions is a tender, well-intentioned examination of a disabled man exploring his sexual identity, but sometimes a film needs more than just good intentions.	2013-11-25
May sound like shameless Oscar-bait, but in truth the film is simpler than that, more small-scale, with a light and unpretentious sense of humor.	2013-07-21
It's difficult not to be impressed with director and screenwriter Ben Lewin's ability to bring this distinctive and surprisingly emotional story to the big screen.	2013-06-30
It's unlike any movie you'll see this year, dealing with delicate subject matter in a refined way.	2013-06-09
What stirs you most is the effortless way Hawkes is able to convey Mark's compassion for people far more fortunate than himself.	2013-05-13
Survival isn't enough. Acceptance isn't enough. Mark needs fulfillment.	2013-03-28
Strong central performances and an endearing premise smooth over some of the more jagged edges of the script.	2013-03-21
Ben Lewin's The Sessions is an emotionally charged film with a smart sense of humor that'll have you tearing up from equal doses of laughter and drama.	2013-03-05
...e motivo de alegria perceber como um homem como Mark O'Brien conseguiu explorar a propria sexualidade mesmo enfrentando a mais brutal e cruel das amarras: nao sua doenca, mas a crenca religiosa.	2013-02-18
An unexpected gem: candid, touching and funny.	2013-01-29
The Sessions proves unusually candid in its matter-of-fact attitude to both sex and nudity.	2013-01-21
(... ) a remarkable film about disability, incapacity and the joy of freedom in the most impossible of situations.	2013-01-20
This funny, moving, beautifully acted movie avoids numerous pitfalls.	2013-01-20
Satisfaction guaranteed? Pretty much.	2013-01-18
It's Hawkes's portrayal, in all its wit, intelligence and childlike naivety, that really captures the heart.	2013-01-18
By taking a sensitive, honest approach to this true story, breakthrough filmmaker Lewin both avoids sentimentality and keeps the focus on the inner lives of the central characters.	2013-01-18
It's a brave performance from Hunt, who spends much of the film entirely naked. Both her and Hawkes are brilliant in a movie that is a massively uplifting experience.	2013-01-17
The movie becomes a touching, often funny portrayal of sex as a form of kindness and human contact.	2013-01-17
Hunt is a prodigy. No other actress could have brought such easeful transparency, such a glow of givingness, such heedlessness of glamour each time she strips naked.	2013-01-17
Not only does it deal with sex in a straightforward manner, but it also deals with the equally sensitive themes of disability and religion, all of which writer/director Ben Lewin pulls off skilfully.	2013-01-17
The Sessions can be sugary, but it's likable.	2013-01-17
You could maybe see it working as a play, though the tactile detail of these scenes needs close-ups on the actors' faces to communicate what the transaction means to them both.	2013-01-17
It's tender, humane and funny and superbly acted; a simple but affecting parable about experiencing life to the fullest.	2013-01-17
Three days after viewing, the film's questioning generosity and sense of perspective will still be knocking around your head.	2013-01-17
The Sessions finally proves that Hollywood can take physical incapacity and/or sex far more seriously than it does the potential side effects of shooting so many people on screen so often.	2013-01-16
A touching gem of a movie largely thanks to subtly dynamic performances from Helen Hunt and John Hawkes.	2013-01-16
Hugely enjoyable, warm-hearted and frequently laugh-out-loud funny disability drama with a superb script and a pair of terrific performances from John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.	2013-01-16
Lewin, who has fought his own lifelong polio battle, handles tricky material with a gentle, empathetic touch.	2013-01-15
Formulaic but uplifting, positive and accessible.	2013-01-14
In its barest form this is a traditional rites-of-passage yarn, dealing in first love and lost innocence, and even with a candid discussion of sex, it's mostly sweetness and light.	2013-01-14
Few movies are so frank about the sexual mechanics of the disabled ...	2013-01-13
All thinking viewers will come away with a better understanding as to how the seemingly different amongst us are really just the one-in-the-same when getting up close and personal.	2013-01-12
Thanks to Lewin's light but assured touch, The Sessions never wears its theological preoccupations heavily, instead allowing transcendence to creep up on the audience quietly.	2013-01-08
For the most part, an authentically subversion take on fringe sexuality.	2013-01-07
The Sessions belongs completely to Hawkes, who disappears into the role of Mark O'Brien, delivering a stunning performance that illuminates what it means to be a whole person.	2013-01-04
A very different kind of love story, breaking taboos lightly, with sensitivity and humor.	2013-01-04
This is one of the best, and certainly one of the best-acted, films of the year. I can't think of another film that mixed compassion and carnality in such an eloquent way.	2012-12-14
The laughs are always gentle, which is descriptive of the film as a whole, as it strives to reconnect cinematic sex with shared humanity.	2012-12-11
Vera is something of a missed opportunity here.	2012-12-08
A movie about sex that shows a whole lot of sex, but isn't sex-obsessed. The Sessions grabs you in the heart rather than the loins.	2012-11-30
An inspiring tale that celebrates the human spirit, underscores the value of connections, and laughs at the beautifully embarrassing urges that make us what we are.	2012-11-30
Deeply moving. The Oscar-worthy (John) Hawkes invests his character with a sense of grace and humor that nullifies any potential pity. This is a great movie for adults and even for older adolescents.	2012-11-28
It is rare to watch a movie where sex is treated with maturity, religion is treated with respect and characters are so heart-warmingly written and portrayed.	2012-11-25
Achieves its sunny disposition by pulling punches.	2012-11-23
Raw, unrestrained and sympathetic without giving in to melodrama, 'The Sessions' is about a man facing a physical challenge who decides he wants to become intimate with a woman.	2012-11-19
An intelligent, funny, insightful film that offers a frank examination of sex. It's not prurient or titillating, just truthful.	2012-11-18
A remarkable actor, John Hawkes, gives a remarkable performance as a remarkable character.	2012-11-17
Surprisingly funny and touching.	2012-11-16
Presents the sensitive O'Brien as a brave, funny, unselfish and unlikely romantic-fantasy dream hero for disappointed, weary or jaded older female moviegoers.	2012-11-16
The uplifting struggle for living a life of dignity for paralyzed from the neck down polio victim Mark O'Brien.	2012-11-16
Taking its cue from Michael Haneke's deeper, crueler Funny Games, The Cabin in the Woods explores why we-sicko viewers-take pleasure in the suffering of others.	2013-11-05
One hottie, one cutie, one stoner, one jock and one intellectual go to a remote cabin in the woods. If this sounds like a setup for a joke, well, it kind of is.	2013-07-31
An original and audacious horror-comedy that oftentimes works better than it should.	2013-06-30
This is a movie that knows it is capitalizing on the cliches and stupidity of its genre, but refuses to bow to the same simple-minded standards to achieve something more	2013-06-29
The Cabin in the Woods is crammed with so many twists and turns that the mere thought of reviewing it and ruining the fun for others is scary in and of itself.	2013-01-22
The Cabin in the Woods manages to throw the horror and comedy genres into a blender, and the result is a delicious product that's ridiculously fun and warrants watching at least once.	2013-01-08
The best movie of the year so far.	2013-01-08
Would you like your head thoroughly messed with? Then check straight into The Cabin in the Woods.	2013-01-08
The pleasure in The Cabin in the Woods comes from its audacious tuggings-away of the dramatic rug under your feet.	2013-01-08
Taking a leaf out of Scream director Wes Craven's book, Joss Whedon both uses and skewers horror film cliches for this enjoyable tongue-in-cheek slasher.	2013-01-08
The Cabin in the Woods is a horror movie about horror movies. Except not really. It's a horror movie about what horror movies do for us, about why narratives of horror mean something to us.	2013-01-08
A fiendishly clever genre Rubik's Cube that demonstrates, if nothing else, how much Fangoria fare benefits from the wicked wit of a real writer.	2013-01-08
Like Scream before it, the film is a simultaneous dissection and celebration of all the tropes to which it pays homage, while also managing to be a superb example of the genre in its own right.	2013-01-08
The Cabin in the Woods is a quick-witted, mind-bending fright fest. A truly rare and original horror film.	2013-01-08
In a year that's looking to have a very strong lineup of horror and genre movies, it's very likely that The Cabin in the Woods will come out the king of the hill.	2013-01-08
The result is a film that might be too smart for its own good, a piece of meta-fiction that's all meta. The Cabin in the Woods isn't trying to scare us as much as it's trying to enlighten us about being scared, then settles for amusing us about it.	2013-01-08
It's not often you can really get a new twist in genre, but this horror movie actually managed to rewrite its own rules thanks to an underlying nihilist sensibility and a fearless approach to formula.	2013-01-08
Whedon's and Goddard's screenplay reads like both a love letter to horror movies and a good-natured treatise on what's wrong with them.	2013-01-08
One of the best movies of 2012 so far, in any genre.	2013-01-04
While this film is not for everyone -- those who like their slasher film cliches without irony shouldn't bother -- anyone who likes brains to go with their blood are bound to appreciate what Whedon and Goddard have conjured.	2013-01-04
Whedon refuses to keep the cliches entirely intact. In keeping with the overall theme, nothing is entirely what it seems, and nobody is entirely who they seem.	2013-01-04
By the time the ride is over, director Drew Goddard and co-writers Goddard and Joss Whedon will change course three or four times, nodding and winking but never losing momentum.	2013-01-04
The Cabin in the Woods is a fiendishly clever, constantly imaginative horror thriller that keeps springing new surprises on the audience right up until the end credits.	2013-01-04
It's all great fun until the ending, which feels a little too safe, simple and silly to what had otherwise been an enjoyably twisted horror film.	2012-12-27
One part horror film, and one part comedy with a hint of self reflection on a genre lacking challenging concepts.	2012-11-16
The Cabin in the Woods is both chilling and cackle-inspiring. Most significantly, it's consistently surprising, and that alone is cause for recommendation in the age of endless reboots and the non-stop barrage of demonic possession movies.	2012-10-15
A surprisingly entertaining effort that works because it strikes a smart balance - embracing as well as rejecting viewer expectations and knowledge of the horror genre.	2012-09-27
Just take my word on it, this film rocks. If you are disillusioned with the state of modern horror (and you should be) this is just the shot in the arm the genre has needed.	2012-09-27
The Cabin in the Woods is nothing short of brilliant.	2012-09-26
This is a must-buy Blu-Ray. The Cabin in the Woods is an excellent movie, it looks and sounds great, and there are plenty of informative bonus features. Highly recommended.	2012-09-17
What I can definitely tell you, without giving away any of its secrets, is that Cabin In The Woods is going to be a pleasant surprise for just about everyone.	2012-09-15
Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard have gone all out to revitalize [the horror genre] with their brilliant take on an old tale.	2012-09-14
The most maniacal monster movie ever created.	2012-08-25
An instant classic, endlessly clever and thrilling, and well worth the wait.	2012-08-22
Playing on the cliches of the genre, the film avoids being a straight-out spoof by building to a satisfying, over-the-top climax.	2012-06-26
The Cabin in the Woods does for horror what Annie Hall did for the romantic comedy.	2012-06-23
The Cabin in the Woods is smart, savage fun written by fans for fans.	2012-06-21
A bloody open love letter to the horror genre that's funny, scary, and thought provoking. One of the best films of 2012.	2012-06-17
Witty, scary and wickedly entertaining, The Cabin in the Woods takes on and savages the biggest monster in the horror genre: caricature.	2012-06-16
I personally wouldn't consider it a game-changer but The Cabin In The Woods kept me on my toes and has many interesting elements.	2012-06-13
Unflinching as it is unconventional, this gory composite of multiple genres also might be the first thinking man's slasher film.	2012-06-03
A mind-blowing horror-show cocktail of gods, movie monsters and mythology.	2012-05-14
What's not to like? Horror fans with a brain will dig the clever script. The gore is there along with a true sense of concern for the victims. If only all horror films could be like "The Cabin in the Woods."	2012-05-06
Some fans may not cotton to its over-the-top evisceration and reanimation of genre history, but I found it exhilarating, like one of those special-issue comic-book splash panels in which the artist tries to squeeze in as many superheroes as possible.	2012-05-04
A smart, and occasionally daring, homage to horror movies that both satirizes the genre and brings new life to it.	2012-05-04
Whedon & Co. obviously have more fun with this genre than most people.	2012-05-03
This horror-reality movie is extremely well-crafted. It has some humor to go with all the mayhem and the story keeps you guessing for a while.	2012-05-03
The Cabin in the Woods revisits the formula that lets viewers feel superior (in terms of knowledge) and also anxious (because of that knowledge).	2012-05-02
It's hard to overlook the transition from smart to smart-assed and the dispensation of credibility for a weightlessly nihilistic punchline.	2012-04-29
... dumbass slasher-movie hokum ...	2012-04-27
"Silver Linings Playbook" makes comic hay from bipolar illness, early death, sexual adventurism, self-improvement binges, football fanaticism, degenerate gambling and father-son estrangement, as one would expect from latter-day Russell movies.	2014-04-16
But Silver Linings Playbook never induces a roll of the eyes, even if it never really surprises.	2013-11-05
In an age when the concept of comedies about possible kinships between characters is dominated by sugary devices and contrivance, here at last is a movie about real situations, real people and the natural experiences that evolve from them.	2013-08-01
A unique dramedy that stands heads and shoulders above most romantic films.	2013-06-30
A wild mess, but what a mess it is.	2013-06-23
It finds the gentle balance between traditional romantic comedy and artistic exploration of the laws of attraction.	2013-06-18
A romantic comedy for people who don't like what Hollywood has been calling 'romantic comedies' these days.	2013-05-22
One of the most pleasurably offbeat experiences since the Philadelphia Eagles last enjoyed a winning season.	2013-05-13
A deft treatment of its delicate subject material and some remarkable performances that give the film both touching, raw, authentic emotion and a certain kinetic humor.	2013-04-23
Jennifer Lawrence is the only aspect of the film that truly lives up to the trumped-up awards buzz and hype, but being a perfectly enjoyable light comedy with heaps of heart is no small feat in itself.	2013-03-31
I love the work that deNiro and Lawrence do here, but ultimately all they do is prove the old adage that you can cover up a lot of problems with the script by hiring good actors.	2013-03-21
"Silver Linings Playbook" could not be a more awkward love story. But I loved every second of it!	2013-03-06
Silver Linings Playbook looks like your run-of-the-mill wacky family comedy, but it's an important film and a great one that deserves to sweep the awards it's nominated for.	2013-02-26
Silver Linings Playbook is defined by the positive decisions that are made in the face of imperfection, desperation, and the desolate wasteland of your world in pieces.	2013-02-23
Director David O. Russell forms a unique and incredible romance dramedy...	2013-02-19
There is some charm to the story, but the final act is very neat, predictable, contrived, and not up to originality of the first two.	2013-02-18
Director David O. Russell is a little too chipper at times - breaking a restraining order is really no joke - but he brings a breeziness to this likeable tale of two misfits trying to make it work.	2013-02-15
It may be a Hollywood comedy, but it's one that feels beautifully alive.	2013-02-11
On the surface Silver Linings Playbook is a raucous romantic comedy, but its real interests are superstition and delusion.	2013-02-04
A volatile mix of familial drama and madcap comedy, infectious optimism and razor-wire wit, it's one of the most purely enjoyable films released in the past twelve months.	2013-02-03
Parece desistir de qualquer traco de originalidade em seu climax, quando se entrega a todos os cliches do genero: mal-entendidos, mocinhos obrigados a correr atras da mocinha pela rua e, claro, o insuportavel travelling circular do beijo romantico.	2013-02-03
I suppose the phrase 'serious romantic comedy' sounds like a paradox. But that's exactly what 'Silver Linings Playbook' is: an intelligent, edgy dark comedy with romance at its core.	2013-02-03
This is a rom-com dressed up as an Oscar-baiting "dramedy". It's a good rom-com thanks to it's edge... but occasionally has the bad traits of a bad rom-com.	2013-01-31
Silver Linings Playbook puts the "fun" in "dysfunction." And sure, that sounds glib, but actually, it's a rather extraordinary achievement. Especially when you're skirting on the edges of sanity.	2013-01-30
A bittersweet pill that's a mixture of an endearing family drama and modern romance that's an absolute delight.	2013-01-30
tows the line of conventional, feel-good Hollywood rom-com, albeit dressed up in just enough art-house quirk to make it feel like something slightly radical	2013-01-30
A reminder that 'sanity' doesn't make your flaws any more orderly.	2013-01-29
Silver Linings Playbook is a fine, funny film, and one that should charm viewers who haven't been tricked by all those Oscar nominations into anticipating it as some kind of world-changing work of art for the ages.	2013-01-28
David O. Russell's latest buzz film straddles a fine line between farce and kitchen-sink drama before settling into a groove that gets under one's skin.	2013-01-27
It starts to fray about halfway through as it shifts into a more conventional mode, taking on the usual trappings of the genre and making its way to a predictable resolution	2013-01-26
Both charming and gritty... Cooper is edgy, while Lawrence is dynamite	2013-01-26
If there's one reason why you should see this film, it's to admire the wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.	2013-01-24
Cooper and Lawrence Shine in Linings.	2013-01-24
Down-to-earth, funnier than you'd expect, and sympathetic toward its volatile, damaged characters.	2013-01-22
Writer-director Russell is just the guy to bring out (and then calm) the manic dysfunction in these folks.	2013-01-22
Just the sheer number of characters flitting around, each scrambling for plot space, gives an idea of just how frantic this movie can be. But Russell expertly uses all of it for maximum emotional -- and sometimes physical -- impact.	2013-01-22
Yes, the marketing presents it as a big broad comedy -- and it certainly is -- but it's also a unique and involving tale of two outsiders who together find a way to get on with life after it has dealt them some bad hands.	2013-01-22
It's tough to go wrong when your movie features two of the hottest stars, but director David O. Russell doesn't stop there.	2013-01-22
Cooper and Lawrence radiate off each other as they run both physically and mentally away from (and towards) each other.	2013-01-22
When Lawrence and Cooper are together, their chemistry jumps and sparks and their rat-a-tat psycho-banter aims for Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell territory.	2013-01-22
A cinematic high-wire act that audaciously blends edgy comedy together with genuinely touching drama into one of the most purely and surprisingly entertaining movies of the year.	2013-01-22
Director David O. Russell, who adapted the novel, and his cast fill the story with engaging, believable characters.	2013-01-22
Fine mainstream sitcom material.	2013-01-21
Writer-director David O. Russell keeps the audience guessing. He takes unexpected twists and turns as if defying you to guess what will come next.	2013-01-19
Consistently engaging, funny, and touching. This is the kind of picture in which two hours of running time whiz by in a flash.	2013-01-18
Silver Linings Playbook is the best movie of 2012 and the acting is mind-boggling good. Give me the Oscar picks, and it wins in every nominated category.	2013-01-18
Succeeds less on the merits of aesthetics than its willingness to give in to crowd-pleasing effervescence.	2013-01-10
A quirky, dramatic and totally entertaining movie that features someof the best acting of the year.	2013-01-09
Having gone from unknown actress to Oscar nominee to "The Hunger Games" in what seemed like a blink of an eye, Lawrence shows herself a master of timing and plays off Cooper brilliantly.	2013-01-06
Silver Linings Playbook doesn't settle for the routine or the cliche. It's a funny drama about imperfect people looking for love. It also happens to be the best romantic comedy in years.	2013-01-04
The Invisible War is as compelling as Silence in the House of God, Alex Gibney's study of abusive Catholic priests.	2014-03-14
Where this picture is truly triumphant, is within the significance of its very existence. This film simply needs to have been made, and it needs to be seen.	2014-03-10
Directed with straightforward economy, The Invisible War sheds much-needed light on a very dark secret.	2014-03-10
Kirby Dick's typically insightful and compassionate documentary presents a harrowing picture of an epidemic of sexual assault and rape within the US military.	2014-03-09
The film works both as advocacy and as a very moving study of women (and one or two men) whose idealism and patriotism have been utterly shattered.	2014-03-07
What calibre of male personnel is the military attracting? And how will this dysfunction affect its relations with foreign civilian populations? It is a grim picture.	2014-03-06
Tears are not hard evidence, but they are hard to resist as anecdotal testimony.	2014-03-06
That the Pentagon has, since the making of this documentary, revamped its rules to try to improve things - in particular, offering immediate transfers for those who allege abuse - is testimony to the power of Dick's work.	2013-02-24
This is an enraging film, as it is meant to be, [and] not just because it is a microcosm of rape culture, the collection of pervasive attitudes that rule our society that deny and dismiss men's violence against women.	2013-02-22
...an erratically-paced yet often harrowing documentary that shines a light on an important (and under-reported) topic.	2013-01-22
Addressing a rarely discussed social problem, Kirby's shocking docu could function as an agent of real change.	2013-01-18
I can hardly wait to see which closet Dick will throw open next.	2013-01-07
The film delivers a sledgehammer blow to the audience, with an experience every bit as shattering and overwhelming as one might infer from the subject matter.	2013-01-07
A must-see expose of the abuse of power in an institution that is supposed to serve and protect.	2013-01-07
I have rarely been more righteously riled up than I was while watching the documentary The Invisible War.	2013-01-07
It's an important, infuriating work. The testimonials from assaulted servicewomen and men should be screened on a loop in recruiting offices around the world.	2013-01-07
Interview after interview, statistic after statistic, Dick's advocacy project thoroughly incenses -- and appears to be having results.	2013-01-07
Let's hope the film causes enough change that we don't have to "discover" such abuses in yet another decade.	2013-01-07
This travesty has been encouraged by a military culture that blames the victim and a policy directing soldiers to refer complaints to their commanding officer, which typically results in no action or even reprisals against those speaking out.	2013-01-07
A disquieting investigative essential documentary that sheds light on the massive problem of rape and the systemic cover-ups in the US military.	2012-11-22
The Invisible War is a crushing indictment of a system that is way off the rails.	2012-11-20
This is one of those documentary films that makes me so angry I could just chew nails. This is because of the awful way the victims of sexual assault are treated by the military establishment.	2012-11-20
makes a compelling case that the military is, as a retired Army general says, "a target-rich environment" for sexual predators. It is a difficult film to watch, but it should be harder to ignore.	2012-09-28
The Invisible War presents 98 minutes of outrage, delineating in painful detail how our country's military has failed so miserably in protecting the women and (in some cases) men who made the choice to serve this nation with courage, pride and dignity.	2012-08-31
Even if you do not see this movie yourself, please encourage any young woman you know who is considering enlistment to watch this movie first.	2012-08-24
Kirby Dick has again shown great restraint in presenting such inflammatory material, betting a clear-eyed approach will have an inflammatory effect on his audience -- and it does.	2012-07-15
Basically, the message from the military to potential rape victims is: if you get raped, it's your own fault...	2012-07-15
One of those documentaries that you watch both fascinated and repulsed - and one of those films that you sense just might be instrumental in helping to change an utterly unacceptable status quo.	2012-07-12
...totally serious but, still, incredibly informative and quite shocking with his plethora of data.	2012-07-07
"The Invisible War" makes all too clear that the military isn't very good at justice.	2012-07-05
In the end there is something to cheer about - vindication for some victims, and proof that a film can make a difference.	2012-07-03
We learn that a military court has determined that rape is 'an occupational hazard' of serving in the military.	2012-07-02
If this enrages you, it should.	2012-06-29
One hearing noted that the victim was dressed provocatively. In her official uniform.	2012-06-28
If it doesn't make you angry, you're not human.	2012-06-27
Agonizing, infuriating - and effective.	2012-06-24
The film is persuasive and infuriating without leaving much hope for change.	2012-06-23
[P]owerful rage against system carried by victims who detail sexism, harassment, stalking, rape, reprisals, and rebuffed complaints [whose] attackers haven't been punished.	2012-06-23
Convincing look at how the military ignores rape and sexual assault within its ranks.	2012-06-22
Powerful, provocative and deeply moving. One of the most vital and enraging documentaries of the year.	2012-06-22
For sheer infuriation value, you can't do much better than Kirby Dick's quietly scathing documentary on rape in the US military.	2012-06-22
Dick, whose films include a revealing expose about the movie industry's film ratings board, has created yet another galvanizing call to action with "The Invisible War."	2012-06-22
What happened to these women after the rape often shocks and disturbs them as much as the physical act itself.	2012-06-21
It is far too difficult to watch. Which means we must.	2012-06-21
This is not a movie that can be ignored.	2012-06-21
Presents a sickening chorus of accounts not just of rape but of institutional betrayal, of a system that's utterly failed to protect or serve those who've joined it.	2012-06-21
The movie depicts the military's culture of intimidation and assault as global, not as an aberration that might be explained by the pressures of combat or the tedium of life on secluded posts.	2012-06-21
Every adult who owes a debt of gratitude to American soldiers should see Kirby Dick's heartbreaking documentary about sexual violence in the military.	2012-06-21
There's a sense that Dick would rather be effective than fair, but The Invisible War wants to tear down walls, and sometimes a sledgehammer comes in handy.	2012-06-21
The intense interviews and damning statistics (20 percent of all female personnel have experienced sexual assault) do the work of whipping up outrage.	2012-06-20
We wake from the best movies as witnesses; we feel the truth of what we have seen and heard, and though we know it's only a movie - just as we know in lucid dreams that we're actually asleep - we cannot help but feel changed by what we have seen.	2014-05-26
a profoundly humane and deeply challenging depiction of the emotional and physical ravages of old age	2013-08-22
Amour is a lesser work from Michael Haneke that features brilliant performances from Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, but is held back by a simplistic narrative.	2013-08-22
Compelling and incredibly heartbreaking...	2013-08-20
a stunning work from a man more capable of provocation than actual insight.	2013-08-17
Michael Haneke gives us an unflinching look at love in the twilight years, placing a lot on the shoulders of two stars who come through like the veterans they are.	2013-08-04
Unnerving in its own way - heartfelt and tender, but with an undercurrent of foreboding.	2013-07-13
This is realism that enlarges our conception of the term.	2013-06-17
Now at the end of the year comes a masterpiece, not just the best of the year, but one of the best ever: Michael Haneke's Amour.	2013-06-13
It leaves you spent, depressed and intensely afraid of the future. In some ways that's admirable, but like our fallible bodies, it gets old - fast.	2013-05-13
Haneke has created a gift for both audiences and the two legendary actors cast in the lead roles.	2013-04-21
In a film that's so explicitly cathartic for the filmmaker, there's a whole lotta catharsis withheld for the audience.	2013-03-18
While [director Michael] Haneke's love of long takes invite you to stare into the corrugated faces of Georges and Anne as their worlds change, there is a leaden quality to many stretches of the film that assume a profundity that simply isn't there.	2013-03-17
Powerful piece of cinema that forces us to confront death and something even worse; the prospect of outliving the love of one's life	2013-02-28
This beautifully-handled, deeply devastating work is all about the most human issue of all: we're all headed for the scrap-heap.	2013-02-28
Movingly acted and extremely harrowing.	2013-02-28
Rarely has this subject matter been depicted so realistically, so honestly. You always know where the story is heading but it's still tough to watch.	2013-02-25
The scenario is upsetting, but the execution is genuine and pure, making Amour a film of heartbreaking beauty and Haneke's masterpiece.	2013-02-24
Amour will now rate highly on a list of my favorite horror movies. It's certainly upsetting. But that is its strength.	2013-02-23
This is a profound look at love about a couple who have lived with each other for so many years, know each other so well and this terrible thing that is facing them and there's a serenity there which makes it even more moving, I think.	2013-02-22
It's Haneke's searing honesty and lack of sentimentality, and his talent as a writer-filmmaker that lifts this film to the heights of achievement. I know that the storyline may sound gloomy, the film is not. It is beyond wonderful.	2013-02-22
Ultimately, the title of the film demands to be taken as a question: is this truly what love looks like? A little smugly, Haneke refuses to answer.	2013-02-22
A multiple award winner at film festivals around the globe, and it is easy to see why. Highly recommended.	2013-02-22
Michael Haneke's most intimate and painfully truthful film - an exploration of what love means at the far end of life.	2013-02-20
This is a movie almost too painful to watch at times, yet so masterfully composed and acted - Riva absolutely deserves her Oscar nomination, while Trintignant was robbed - that it's impossible to turn away.	2013-02-19
Georges' irreversible decision may be courageous, but it requires no sacrifice on the part of his creator: for Haneke, it's business as usual.	2013-02-18
Trintignant and Riva are unforgettably brilliant as the aging couple we can all identify with.	2013-02-18
Haneke's startling film stands in stark contrast with other recent, comedic fare that seemingly addresses similar issues.	2013-02-17
My review is categorized as 'favourable' not because I enjoyed the film (that's not Michael Haneke's intent) but because I recognise what he is trying to say and that he says it with a unique cinematic voice	2013-02-16
Debilitation and loss of control is a harsh topic, yet Haneke's film is surprisingly gentle, exploring the constraints and options faced, as old age delivers its ultimate blow - the loss of self and ability to function with dignity	2013-02-16
Amour is a pure depiction of love, in all its many forms.	2013-02-15
The furthest thing from sweet sorrow imaginable, Amour gets real about the pain of parting in every sense of the word.	2013-02-13
This subject matter is ripe for sentimentalization, but Haneke resists it at every turn, opting instead for unflinching honesty. It is the economy of theme paired with the subtle richness of character that make Amour so powerful.	2013-02-12
Clearly, Amour, Michael Haneke and Emmanuelle Riva don't really need me to additionally sing their praises (although praise is indeed all I have), so let's discuss Jean-Louis Trintignant for a moment.	2013-02-09
Trintignant perfectly captures the resolve that eventually borders on obsession, as the woman he loves gradually, maddeningly, disappears before his eyes, and he does whatever he can to prevent it, though he knows it's impossible.	2013-02-08
All is presented in Haneke's exacting style, one that I find controlling and a bit, well, smothering.	2013-02-08
An insightful, memorable film about what it means to love.	2013-02-08
Many viewers will find echoes of their grandparents, parents, or even themselves in these characters.	2013-02-08
A movie that is utterly worthy of its all-encompassing title.	2013-02-08
A tale about love at its most terribly, backbreakingly difficult.	2013-02-08
The resulting interplay of ruthless restraint and unavoidable passion, plus the film's refusal to shrink from depicting the inevitable horrors of physical deterioration, is devastating.	2013-02-08
In many ways, it's a horror film, as the woman descends into helplessness, and - like the audience - the man can only watch. It's a potent piece of filmmaking.	2013-02-07
The superb Trintignant and the Oscar-nominated Riva -- who would win, in a just world -- embody once-vigorous people in inevitable decline.	2013-02-07
For Haneke, love is just another curious human trait to be dissected and used as a tool to disquiet his audience.	2013-02-07
A poignant tale of undying love!	2013-02-04
Beautifully acted and unflinching, Amour goes where few movies have the courage to	2013-02-01
Riva's performance is undeniably magnificent, as she must chart every step of Anne's physical and mental deteriorating with exacting precision.	2013-02-01
In many ways it's the best horror film I've ever seen. At the same time, it's hard to recommend; I believe I will be struggling to forget this film as long as I live. I doubt I'll succeed.	2013-02-01
Sadly effective, with two standout performances.	2013-01-31
Death, illness and tragedy transcend demographics, and the characters in "Amour" are all of us in the end.	2013-01-31
As the project hits its half-century mark, with the "kids" settling into middle age, the signature cross-cutting between then, now and everything in between feels downright Proustian in its emotional depth.	2014-01-01
Apted, now 72, has said he'll keep calling on his subjects every seven years until he or they are dead. Whether the subjects show up or not, I for one will be in line when 63 Up comes around.	2014-01-01
This suffers as well from the fact that the subjects' lives haven't changed all that much since 49 Up (2005); perhaps the series will improve yet as they head into old age.	2014-01-01
The original documentary was intended to illustrate how the country's deeply ingrained class system inscribed itself on the aspirations and inner lives of its young people. But the successive movies have been far less polemical.	2014-01-01
We're now at 56 Up,, and with each passing calendar leap, the experience of watching has only become more soul-stirring.	2014-01-01
a window into our shared human experience, and a terrific one at that.	2013-07-08
56 Up has become a stirring reflection, even tribute, to the little bends and turns of ordinariness, the ebbs and surges of everyday lives.	2013-05-06
Apted's subjects would object to the idea that we really know them, but we think we do -- and that's good enough to make his film feel like a reunion, a visit with an old friend. Or 14 of them.	2013-04-11
Yes, on some level it's just a seven-year check-in with people maybe half-remembered, if that. Yet the films also serve as a kind of check-in with us, too.	2013-03-28
Chances are that you'll come away from this long film feeling a sense of knowing its characters.	2013-03-21
We might say that '56 Up' serves much the same function as 'Amour,' but it responds to the inevitability of decline with compassion, not dread.	2013-03-08
What started as a crafty way of looking at the U.K.'s rigid class structure has grown into a portrait of melancholy middle age, with its heartbreaks and minor-key triumphs.	2013-02-28
Those British kids are now 56	2013-02-22
Watching the eighth film is intriguing but, in a way, disappointing. At this point in the game, it feels as if all the characters have determined their lots in life and are simply plodding through their interviews.	2013-02-21
What ultimately is so compelling about 56 Up is the universality of the experiences. We were all once children. And we all will die. And in between, there is everything else.	2013-02-21
Quite simply one of the great documentary projects in the history of cinema, an engrossing sociological experiment on film; and though this mostly mellow installment isn't as revelatory as some earlier ones, it's still a remarkable document.	2013-02-21
... feels like a retrospective and summation of the whole series, with ample quotation from the previous films, an approach that makes it interesting even for viewers who haven't seen the previous installments.	2013-02-15
We feel good, refreshed and depressed in watching these people get older, also embarrassed in moments and cautioned about the passage of time.	2013-02-14
A completely unique and remarkable documentary project.	2013-02-14
Apted skillfully weaves old footage with the new, and we become poignantly aware of another factor shaping their lives (and our own): biology, as the we watch the once-cute kids grow gray and heavy.	2013-02-14
Perhaps the boldest and probably longest running sociological experiment on film.	2013-02-09
I think the best thing about this movie (and the entire series) is that it forces the viewer to think about their own lives. It's kind of an awakening experience.	2013-02-07
Apted, himself now in his early 70s, says he hopes to continue the series further. Long may it live.	2013-02-07
Watching "56 Up" gives you the wonderful feeling of seeing a sociological experiment blossom into something novelistically rich and humane.	2013-02-07
Time has been neither kind nor cruel to the 13 men and women profiled in "56 UP." It has just been time, which is what this groundbreaking series is about.	2013-02-07
Once again, Apted assembles a captivating documentary that's profoundly educational, essential viewing to aid the understanding of the human experience.	2013-02-07
"56 Up" is well worth seeing.	2013-02-07
56 Up is still moving and philosophic, though not as exciting as earlier episodes, which had more drama.	2013-02-05
The running time is over two hours, but the lives here are richly revealed and vastly rewarding.	2013-02-01
We are all older now, and this series proves it in a most deeply moving way.	2013-01-31
Inevitably, one looks in the mirror afterward and thinks, What have I lost? What have I gained? And at what cost?	2013-01-28
Apted possesses the unsettling ability to shape perceptions of their lives and personalities from inside an editing suite, a fact that the members of his flock begin to recognize at varying points throughout their adult years.	2013-01-25
...can be seen and appreciated by both those who have followed series and those to whom it is all new.	2013-01-24
It's like the startling time lapse photography of "Chasing Ice" had been applied to the human race.	2013-01-24
See you again in 7 years, friends.	2013-01-24
In the eighth installment of Michael Apted's epochal documentary series, his aging participants (one of cinema's greatest assemblage of living characters) provide not just a telescope into the past but also a kind of primer for how to live.	2013-01-24
To see "56 Up" is to be reunited with an old friend.	2013-01-17
The granddaddy of longitudinal documentaries impressively reaches grandparenthood. . . continuing to reveal as much about the heard (but not seen) Apted as his interviewees.	2013-01-16
Continuing Michael Apted's insightful commentary on how life can be full of surprises.	2013-01-13
The latest, and perhaps greatest installment in a great documentary series. Moving, amusing and eye-opening.	2013-01-12
"56 Up" reminds us that change is ceaseless and often dramatic, bringing growth we could never have dreamed of as little kids.	2013-01-10
Apted creates a graceful back-and-forth from the earlier films to the present, and the experience of seeing people who have lived so much on screen is quite profound.	2013-01-10
The effect is often profoundly moving, but you can't help but feel at times like there are other stories here you're missing.	2013-01-07
For those of us already fans of the series and invested in the characters over the course of seven films and 42 years it's a necessary continuation and curiosity.	2013-01-05
Being able to view this slice of life (no matter how contrived or edited it may be by the shows producers) provides an enjoyable and provocative perspective into humanity.	2013-01-04
What gives the series its force is not just its universality but also its particularity. These grown-ups may be Everyman, but they are also singular.	2013-01-04
More reflective than previous entries, 56 UP is also a richer, fuller, more emotional experience	2013-01-04
"56 Up" is a rather bittersweet chapter, as age begins to further narrow those possibilities already defined at birth. And it hints that "63 Up," if we get there, may be sadder still.	2013-01-04
If 56 Up is something of a pleasant bore while you're watching it, it gains more resonance when you think about it as the calm before the approaching storm.	2013-01-04
'56 Up" is as good a point as any to get hooked on the magnificent half-century series of documentaries ...	2013-01-04
Comprova a promessa representada pela estreia de Joachim Trier.	2014-05-27
Sad, but wise, and clear-eyed about what it means to drift through life until it's suddenly too late to turn back.	2013-06-23
The beauty is in the array of animated faces in Anders' life. And it's in the simple promise and vitality of Anders' face, which serves the film without any regard for being in a film, let alone a tragedy or a poetic vision of darkness and futility.	2013-06-14
With a predilection for long takes, alternating between tripod setups and handheld camera work that's reflective of Anders' unease, Trier presents life as an unceasingly tepid stream of the mundane -- with an occasional, exquisite pinprick of hope.	2013-01-08
Life's sadder moments are quite well displayed in Trier's nuanced approach. For many popcorn munchers, that regrettably doesn't translate as a must-see movie in today's crowded marketplace...	2012-09-28
It's an absolutely moving and devastating film, and one of the most jarring looks at addiction you'll ever see on screen.	2012-09-25
The movie transpires mostly in quiet, engrossing dialogue scenes, and its austere style shares a good deal in common with the protagonist, who seems both opaque and completely exposed.	2012-08-31
In a single day, through a single pair of eyes, Trier and Lie give us an emblem for the world.	2012-08-30
[Displays] an invigoratingly acute understanding of the psychology of insecurity, longing, defensiveness and inward-turning rage.	2012-08-30
"Oslo, August 31st" is quietly, profoundly, one of the most observant and sympathetic films I've seen.	2012-08-30
The film is perhaps the most emotionally devastating and yet paradoxically delicate effort of the year, a genuine gem.	2012-08-29
A coolly observed yet boundlessly compassionate day in the life of a recovering drug addict, "Oslo, August 31st" breaks your heart many times over.	2012-08-29
Spanning a short period of time, this tense and intense Norweigian drama about a drug addict is extremely well directed and acted.	2012-08-24
As the final shots mirror the first, you reflect on how life goes on, with and without us.	2012-08-23
Trier proves that he's no one-hit wonder.	2012-08-17
The result is a superb exploration of loss, guilt and regret in Norwegian director Joachim Trier's often-unpredictable second film.	2012-08-10
It has absolute clarity about a character who isn't at all sure about what he wants - or whether he wants to keep going at all.	2012-08-10
[Screenwriters] Trier and Vogt are neat and cunning.	2012-08-08
Pared down and sparse, almost Bressonian in its formal rigor...	2012-08-02
A study of a man who pulled away from the edge of the abyss at the nick of time, only to realize he may not be able to forgive himself for the things he's done.	2012-07-26
Te movie seems more like a searing portrait of self-discovery and realization, with the understanding that not everything you learn about yourself will be pleasant.	2012-07-19
There are echoes, a little DNA of "Wings of Desire" here.	2012-07-15
A powerful, upfront document of a recovering drug addict confronting the demons of his past.	2012-07-02
It's Trier's skill at humanely communicating the deep loneliness of a ruined life that make him a new filmmaker deserving your attention.	2012-07-02
A remarkable film with a mesmerizing performance by actor Lie.	2012-06-26
Trier ... keeps us aware of the emotions and perceptions of all the characters, even at those times when their perceptions are limited and differ from objective reality.	2012-06-21
With his angular features and intense gaze, Lie is utterly convincing as an intellectual in the process of repairing his damaged life.	2012-06-07
"Oslo" is an example of strong, confident filmmaking in which nothing is miscalculated or out of place.	2012-05-31
... a gritty and authentic portrait of the unseen post-abuse perils that addiction creates.	2012-05-25
Though the film provides a gentle wash of dark feelings, one can't help but feel cleansed by it and more alive when it ends.	2012-05-25
Despite its themes, "Oslo, August 31st" is an exhilarating film, with impeccable direction and pitch-perfect performances that make the bleakness worthwhile.	2012-05-25
"Oslo, August 31st" has the satisfying gravity of specific experience, and also, true to its title, a prickly sense of place.	2012-05-24
It's a marvelously constructed personal journey, both wrenching and bittersweet, whose emotional ripple effects stay with you for days and weeks afterward.	2012-05-24
In its depiction of a man who's considering death, the film is never less than fully alive.	2012-05-24
With only two films, Danish director Joachim Trier has soundly established himself as a singular talent.	2012-05-24
...a quietly stunning masterpiece-all of life, in a single day.	2012-05-24
Trier's compassion for what it takes to survive, mixed with the love he bestows on Oslo, is rewardingly profound.	2012-05-23
Moment to moment, you sense the fragility of Anders's fate as it hangs in the balance.	2012-05-22
As this elegiac movie reminds us, even a shattered life matters, leaving behind an indelible, intricate imprint.	2012-05-22
[It] crosses the blood-brain barrier like ... like ... whatever the drug is, I haven't tried it, thank God.	2012-05-21
Without any flashiness or grandstanding, Joachim Trier and Anders Danielsen Lie make us sympathize with the character on a deeply personal level.	2012-04-13
A searing portrait of a young man's chronic loneliness.	2012-03-26
The evocation of things ending suffuses the film with melancholy, as Anders increasingly becomes an observant rather than a participant in his own life.	2012-03-19
Trier delivers a sedate, mature follow-up to his brash, energetic debut Reprise.	2011-11-20
Less a study of the desire to die than the terrifying realisation that there is no reason left to live.	2011-11-09
It's a cold, detached, very Scandinavian film, neither as sharp nor as oddly exhilarating as Malle's.	2011-11-06
While not a film for the dispirited - though such a mindset may better empathise with Anders' soul-searching journey - it does have a peculiar honesty to it.	2011-11-06
Lie's performance is pitch perfect, and Trier's direction almost flawless.	2011-11-04
A very rewarding and worthwhile film.	2011-11-03
Trier's film takes us to some desperate places, but it earns that despair with clear eyes, and the sense of character is finely-honed...	2011-11-03
To say Ai Weiwei is an interesting character is an understatement. He is an unconventional social activist and a thorn in the side of the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party.	2013-01-01
Ai Weiwei is such a laid back, calm and yet mischievous spirit that the film takes on a whole different, almost joyous tone.	2012-12-18
The film is about the power and limits of art.	2012-12-07
Klayman never demonizes the authoritarian Chinese government, as her purpose seems to be to show how difficult it is to be a rebel in such a closed society as China.	2012-11-27
A compelling documentary that explodes proper and stuffy notions of what a foreign intellectual dissident looks and sounds like.	2012-09-26
The struggle for free speech in China is given sharp, sobering, disturbing voice through the struggles of cutting edge, digitally savvy, Twitter-loving artist Ai Weiwei.	2012-09-21
Alison Klayman's remarkable film about China's leading 'digital dissident' fully illustrates the talents of a man who often does the opposite of what you'd expect.	2012-09-19
... straightforward, entertaining and provocative documentary about the titular Chinese artist	2012-09-07
A fascinating portrait of a modern artist and activist trying to make a difference within China's repressive political system.	2012-09-07
Even if you don't like documentaries as a rule, I'm betting you'll like Ai Weiwei himself so much that you'll be glad you took the time to get to know him through this film.	2012-09-04
Klayman deserves a lot of credit for being in the right place at the right time with the right person. Ai is a treat to follow around, and his courage is clearly more than a pose.	2012-08-26
An unprecedented inside look at Chinese politics and a fascinating tour of modern art at the same time.	2012-08-23
A powerful film that teaches us as much about ourselves as it does it's subject, "Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry," is a sure bet to be nominated for an Oscar come January 2013.	2012-08-19
This riveting documentary deserves consideration for year-end awards. Klayman gained unprecedented access to this very photogenic man with a dynamic personality.	2012-08-16
The film's recurring theme is of an artist on a perpetual hunt for transparency, in his country and abroad.	2012-08-16
A lively, informative, funny and inspirational portrait of a courageous, charismatic, highly original man.	2012-08-12
His willingness to speak out despite severe consequences is inspiring, and his recent silence speaks almost as loudly as his work in calling attention to China's repressive tactics.	2012-08-10
This essential, finely honed biographical portrait is jollied along by all the ironies and complexities of modern China.	2012-08-10
Who doesn't hate it when critics say, "this is an important documentary you must see!" Well, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry is a critically important documentary you need to see.	2012-08-10
Well worth seeing.	2012-08-10
Though we might wish for more insight or explanation, Klayman's film remains an incredible document of a courageous individual who the Chinese officials would prefer to make disappear.	2012-08-10
A movie that somehow mixes apprehension for Ai with a feeling of warmth and, certainly, fun.	2012-08-10
Affable and unpretentious, Ai comes across as a cagey operator whose candor is very appealing.	2012-08-09
He is heroic.	2012-08-09
It's likely to change the way you think about art and politics and the state of China today.	2012-08-09
The boundaries between performance and protest are virtuosically, vitally fuddled in this stirring documentary chronicling three years in the life of Ai Weiwei, the outspoken Chinese artist and dissident.	2012-08-09
Using archival footage dating back to Ai's adventures in the New York art world in his 20s, Klayman traces his evolution as a creator and as an activist.	2012-08-09
The artist repudiated the repudiation. Art had, as art always should have, the last word.	2012-08-09
Fascinating account of Weiwei's practice and politics that gives centre stage to his charismatic personality.	2012-08-09
This is how a documentary portrait should be done.	2012-08-09
Klayman's all-access, warts-and-all coverage of this artist's struggles with the State represents an extension of Ai's own ideals about transparency and freedom of expression.	2012-08-09
[H]as a sense of the gloss to it: Ai is such a complex man, and he's operating in an environment that is alien to most Westerners, and so at every turn here, I wanted to get into much more depth than Klayman takes us to.	2012-08-09
A powerful picture, yet, even more impressively, it treats art like a vessel for communication and meaningful exploration, not just as a stepping stone to cult fame.	2012-08-09
In terms of getting his message out to a wider audience, this film simply and effectively serves as part of the cause.	2012-08-07
Klayman exploits the opportunity to follow a man at the eye of a cultural and political storm, although more detail on his creative process and private life would have welcome.	2012-08-06
Though he has paid the price, Ai is a pathfinder in this new phenomenon in tactical insurrection. Never Sorry is a new-style profile in 21st-century courage.	2012-08-03
Ai admits that he's become "a brand for liberal thinking and individualism," though that's nothing to be ashamed of -- at this point, his Warholian talent for self-promotion may be the only thing keeping him alive.	2012-08-03
Structurally ragged but engrossing documentary [about] a courageous provocateur with a gift for cleverly ridiculing a dangerous regime.	2012-08-03
An excellent, revelatory new documentary. Weiwei proves a thoroughly compelling subject.	2012-08-03
The story is enthralling, but it's not over, and there's no telling where it's going. Which makes what we see on screen all the more involving.	2012-08-03
You come away with an appreciation of the abstraction, scale and daring of Ai's art and, even more, a sense of the living man in his courage, humor and restlessness. It's an invigorating experience.	2012-08-02
A sobering, cautionary tale.	2012-08-02
One of the most engagingly powerful movies of the year almost completely on the strength of Ai's rumpled charisma and the confusion it creates in the bureaucratic mindset of the Chinese Communist Party.	2012-08-02
The finale, as Ai's Twitter tirades lead to a serious human-rights breach, will make your blood boil.	2012-07-31
A vital, informative wake-up call that will make you feel equally enraged and inspired.	2012-07-28
Doesn't mask its awe of the man, who comes off as a cross between a wise Buddha-figure and Santa Claus	2012-07-27
As this sometimes haphazard documentary shows, Ai won't stop talking. Or blogging. Or tweeting.	2012-07-27
A useful primer, though it also focuses a bit more on the activism than on the art.	2012-07-26
He may still seem enigmatic, but we don't need to know his deepest thoughts. The intensity of his daily life and the persecution he continues to face is more than enough to understand who he is and what he is enduring.	2012-07-26
Klayman had full access to Ai, 55, following him around for two years. The sweetest footage involves Ai and his mother.	2012-07-26
I was surprised at just how much of a great, thrilling time I had. It's a film that genuinely earns its stripes as a grand, epic work of cinema.	2013-09-08
No villain could come close to matching Ledger's inspired Joker, but give Hardy credit for supplying Bane with plenty of conviction and gravitas in a movie that, frankly, is less about actors than knockout set pieces captured in eyeball-popping spectacles.	2013-08-03
Caps off the trilogy with passion and dignity, if not always with slam-bang entertainment. Whoever directs the reboot in five years will have a lot to live up to.	2013-07-16
The movie's two hours and 44 minutes long but never drags, and it has at least five separate action set pieces that will drop your jaw, particularly if you see it in IMAX.	2013-06-23
The Dark Knight Rises captures the spirit -- and cultural anxieties -- of the times.	2013-06-20
The final installment in Christopher Nolan's pitch-black trilogy manages to be both relevant and topical while slavishly adhering to the stodgy tropes of the genre.	2013-05-26
Gloom never looked as good as it does in the mesmerizing "The Dark Knight Rises."	2013-05-17
Even with its flaws, The Dark Knight Rises is a solid film. It just fails to live up to the magnificent legacy created by the first two movies in the trilogy. To be fair, they were incredibly hard acts to follow.	2013-04-12
Every facet of this impressive piece reaffirms the same thematic gristle as it forces the viewer to chew on the notion of personal responsibility.	2013-04-12
The Dark Knight Rises is all about risks, and there are payoffs and failures to go with it.	2013-04-12
This is a solid film, taking itself seriously and asking that we do the same.	2013-04-12
It's not un-entertaining. Exhausting, a bit, but not un-entertaining.	2013-04-12
An ambitious, honourable and satisfying conclusion to this genre-defining trilogy.	2013-03-04
The Dark Knight Rises directly counters the arguments made against The Dark Knight. Maybe, sometimes, it is better to leave the demons unvanquished.	2012-12-31
Technically, The Dark Knight Rises is a thick leatherbound volume with gilded pages, though flipping through it yields a story about a big bad bald man doing eeevil things until a vigilante with pointy ears comes to the rescue.	2012-12-17
Weighed down by portentousness and momentousness. The overall story remains a bit muddled. A better trilogy-capper than a movie in its own right.	2012-11-22
There's plenty of action, intrigue, special effects, and high-tech gadgets to maintain our attention at least in spurts.	2012-11-20
There's enough that works in The Dark Knight Rises that I can overlook most of the more glaring flaws, but it remains to date the most disappointing film I've seen from 2012.	2012-11-05
Nolan keeps things dark and dangerous	2012-10-20
Doubtless flawed and arguably overlong, it's nonetheless a personal and heartfelt ode from the director to the greatest comic-book character ever committed to paper -- and now film.	2012-10-19
Nolan's finale isn't perfect, and may not be the greatest installment of the trilogy, but it solidifies this three-part tale of the Batman legend as one of the best ever told.	2012-10-02
... if Gotham falls, so does Bruce Wayne. Rarely, in film, have we understood and sympathised with a hero's mission as much as Bruce's.	2012-09-27
The Dark Knight Rises succeeds in surpassing 2008's 'The Dark Knight' to become the best of his three films. Whether that will be enough to secure his Best Picture Oscar is frankly irrelevant - because what matters is that this is Batman's best picture.	2012-09-26
The Dark Knight Rises is the film event of the summer. A completely satisfying piece of filmmaking that delivers so much more, making for an excellent sign off for one of cinema's finest trilogies.	2012-09-14
[It] may be the weakest film in the trilogy, but it is still a satisfactory and exciting conclusion to what has been the greatest treatment of any superhero in film history.	2012-09-12
Every shred of wit, mystery and humanity is pummeled out, leaving only a bullish mishmash of zeitgeisty anxiety	2012-09-04
Disconnected significantly from the flow of logic between the first and second installments of Christopher Nolan's "Batman" films, "The Dark Knight Rises" is a disjointed mess.	2012-08-30
Nolan again transforms Bob Kane's classic DC Comics creation into a superhero for our times, flawed but fighting against supervillains and also the decay and corruption that created them.	2012-08-25
Manages to mitigate its slew of shortcomings with a cinematically-administered, turbo-charged dose of adrenaline in the form of its sublimely symphonic finale.	2012-08-24
Contains images destined to become classics of what we might call pretentious popular culture. For example: Batman and Bane, slugging it out on the steps of a neoclassical downtown building, in the midst of a sunlit snowstorm...	2012-08-24
When the credits roll at the end of this overlong action epic, it feels like we've just turned the final page of an immersive novel	2012-08-24
It addresses the darkness in everyday life, acknowledges the pain, and fights back.	2012-08-22
A powerful film. A great film. A messy film nonetheless.	2012-08-21
The narrative sleight-of-hand aside as a finale it satisfies, even for those of us who weren't enamoured with the previous instalments.	2012-08-14
...Nolan's final Batman film shows the inhabitants of Gotham wrestling with issues of the real world, namely: money, class, and power.	2012-08-10
The last act of the film delivers in a shocking way. What comes before it is imperfect, but since we're talking about Nolan here, it's still worth seeing, discussing, and then seeing again.	2012-08-07
a canny Obama-era blockbuster, feeding equally into rightwing fears of the unwashed mashes and leftwing anger at the dominance of the much loathed one-percent	2012-08-03
A reasonably entertaining late-summer entry in the never-ending parade of youth-market fantasy sequels.	2012-08-02
Christopher Nolan ends a near perfect trilogy of dark and intelligent Batman films with a near perfect third leg in a marvelous re-imagining of the Dark Knight...	2012-07-31
The story is dense, overlong, and studded with references that will make sense only to those intimate with Nolan's previous excursions into Batmanhood.	2012-07-30
Perhaps the best way to summarize the movie is to borrow the final line from one of the comics that inspired it: The Dark Knight Rises is a good film. Good enough.	2012-07-29
... Nolan thinks small in a big way... providing an imperfect yet satisfying conclusion, and that in itself is quite an accomplishment.	2012-07-29
Christopher Nolan's Batman saga comes to an end with this engrossing and absolutely spellbinding installment...	2012-07-29
The weakest of Nolan's three Batmans with offputting politics and a dull villain but its fascinatingly vertical construction and Catwoman save it.	2012-07-28
Rises a Satisfying Conclusion to Nolan's Trilogy.	2012-07-28
It gets away from the great Christopher Nolan for a time during the film's soft middle, but he brings the conclusion to his Batman trilogy home with a bang.	2012-07-27
All in all, the gifted (writer-director Christopher) Nolan's latest epic is typically well-constructed (despite a plot hole here and there) and beautiful to look at.	2012-07-27
Enjoying TDKR requires messiah-like trust in Nolan that he'll eventually reward us, as long as we don't get too hung up on all the plot holes and leftover genre tropes.	2012-07-27
A bit of a letdown, containing nothing close to the brilliance of the late Heath Ledger's performance in the previous film, but it doesn't glorify nihilism, chaos and anarchy like the previous film did because it's villains aren't charismatic.	2012-07-27
The summer's most grandiose, grown-up, operatic superhero movie, one that makes others look, in comparison, like kids playing around in action-figure pajamas.	2012-07-27
a carefully constructed observation of the facts and a withering condemnation of the behaviour of the Catholic Church.	2013-04-23
Before you say you can't take another feature length documentary about sexual abuse committed by Catholic priests, know that Alex Gibney's examination of the subject is both fresh and revelatory.	2013-03-28
Gibney tracks a disgraceful cover-up within the Catholic church.	2013-03-24
A heartbreaking, brilliantly executed expose, in which four deaf victims bring the church to account. Their testimonies are chilling.	2013-03-24
Alex Gibney isn't casting the first stone at the Vatican with his documentary Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God. But, God willing, it will be the most effective in shattering their narrative of blissful ignorance.	2013-03-21
Tragedy that sticks to your bones -- a gut-punch look at the Catholic Church child sex abuse scandal as filtered through the experiential prism of a group of victims from a single Midwestern school for the deaf.	2013-03-20
With meticulous care and intricate detail, Silence In The House of God deconstructs the nature of the Catholic Church's systematic cover ups of pedophilia among their clergy, stretching back well into the past century	2013-03-15
It is ironic that the raised voices of a small group of deaf boys from Milwaukee, Wisconsin are loud enough to threaten the code of silence over child molestation accusations in the Catholic Church	2013-03-15
It's not one documentary that you'd care to endure on repeat viewings but it's a necessary investigation into the paedophilic petri dish that the Catholic Church allowed itself to become.	2013-03-06
It's impossible to leave the cinema without hoping that the Papal resignation and the awful events explored here are not unrelated.	2013-02-26
It's a lucid film everyone should see and the Vatican should answer for.	2013-02-17
There's a reason this expertly shot and edited documentary is skimming under the radar: no one wants you to see it. The hugely skilled Gibney is taking on the world's biggest corporation, the Vatican.	2013-02-15
[A] harrowing expose of child abuse within the Roman Catholic Church, which reveals the extent the Vatican has been actively involved in covering up crimes committed by priests.	2013-02-15
A kind of unintentional leaving gift for the outgoing Pope Benedict, though it is not one he is likely to relish.	2013-02-14
The film shocks you to the marrow, and every frame burns with a righteous fire, itself religious in its intensity.	2013-02-14
The case has been widely reported but this is still an important film, laying out who knew what, and when. It's chilling: the conspiracy of silence goes all the way to the Vatican.	2013-02-14
This is a tremendous documentary: at once cool and scalding, outraged and meticulous; a must-see for everyone, both inside and outside the "House of God".	2013-02-14
Impressively directed and thoroughly researched, Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God is a powerful and deeply upsetting documentary that demands to be seen.	2013-02-14
Details the ways, in the face of devastating evidence, that the Catholic Church attempted to cover-up a priest's serial criminality.	2013-02-12
If you thought that Amy Berg's Deliver Us from Evil had extracted every last word on the issue of child abuse in the Catholic Church, Alex Gibney proves with his new film that there's still plenty left to be infuriated about.	2013-02-11
It may look like a documentary but Gibney's film is a horror film in every sense. Essential, uncomfortable viewing.	2013-02-11
'Angry' doesn't even begin to cover how this film makes me feel. It probably won't cover you, either.	2013-02-04
Rigorously exposing systemic corruption and collusion, Gibney traces the problem to the top, detailing how the Vatican closed ranks to protect itself.	2013-02-04
Even though Mea Maxima Culpa can be incredibly sad and frustrating, the film is able to go beyond the tragedy of these boys' lost childhoods, using that empathy to incite anger, impatience and action in its audience.	2012-11-29
The past persists, and in Mea Maxima Culpa, it finds powerful expression.	2012-11-26
Deaf victims passionately sign about years of anguish and pleas [but film] rambles. . .around the world [and] confusingly tries to pierce hierarchy to what pope knew when.	2012-11-25
Well done and compelling, and at its strongest when focusing on the bravery of these four deaf men who broke the silence.	2012-11-16
This disturbing documentary takes a revealingly close look at rampant clerical pedophilia--but its sweeping overview of the Catholic Church's willful obliviousness is just as eye-opening.	2012-11-16
It feels a bit like a monster movie. It is, too.	2012-11-16
In the end, decades of such crimes going undetected and undeterred under the aegis of one employer - any employer - speaks for itself. And the extraordinary perseverance and courage of the men from St. John's speaks louder still.	2012-11-16
Partly an inspiring saga of growing "deaf power" and human resilience, and partly a murky and fragmentary drama about an immense, closed-minded bureaucracy with paranoid and conspiratorial tendencies that finds itself unable to adjust to the modern world.	2012-11-15
There is something to be said for a clear and unblinking recitation of facts, and thankfully Mr. Gibney does a lot of that.	2012-11-15
Gibney's most powerful film since the Oscar-winning 2007 Taxi to the Dark Side.	2012-11-15
Fearless nonfiction filmmaker Alex Gibney details a history of horrific abuse by Catholic clergy in this tough-to-watch documentary.	2012-11-15
A shocking and poignant documentary about the Catholic Church's cover-up of sexual abuse and the victims who heroically came forward to break their silence.	2012-11-15
Primed to deliver a heady dose of outrage via a broad overview of systemic cover-ups tracing to the Vatican, as well as a specific and heartbreaking case in Wisconsin.	2012-11-15
To someone who was raised and educated in the Catholic school system, as I was, a film like this inspires shock and outrage.	2012-11-15
The film is one-sided, of course-church officials ignored interview requests, but their version has been around for a couple of millennia anyway.	2012-11-13
Mea Maxima Culpa only gets messier the more it tries to iris out to a larger indictment. The central tragedy ends up diluted to a fault.	2012-11-13
I don't speak Latin, but I'm pretty sure that "Mea Maxima Culpa" translates into, "Good grief, don't watch this movie without access to some Excedrin."	2012-11-13
Powerful enough to leave you wondering whether the Catholic Church will ever stop protecting child molesters.	2012-11-12
No one of true faith will get over Maxima Mea Culpa.	2012-11-12
Alex Gibney's latest lacks a certain cinematic depth, but that doesn't take away from its admirable reporting.	2012-11-11
[VIDEO ESSAY] You could come away from the movie thinking that the Catholic Church is nothing more than an impermeable mafia of fascist monsters who prey on little boys.	2012-11-06
Gibney's most successful and rich work since Taxi To The Dark Side, Mea Maxima Culpa ultimately proves most successful in the way it balances public scandal with a tribute to human frailty and heroism.	2012-10-26
Damning doc pairs an individual sex-abuse case with analysis of institutional dysfunction at the Vatican.	2012-10-12
A well-constructed and poignant argument, full of outrage and ample evidence, about the heinous crimes and cover-ups that have taken place in the Catholic Church.	2012-10-12
A powerful, necessary contribution to a chilling body of reportage that, one senses by film's end, has just begun to take stock of the human costs of a monstrous conspiracy.	2012-10-12
A thousand words? Try two words: stay away. Murphy does a pretty good job keeping up with the various indignities heaped on him but the movie as a whole ends up sinking.	2012-09-15
a poorly conceived and startlingly miscast comedy that works to every one of its stars' weaknesses.	2012-08-30
You've got one of the funniest verbal actors in the business in Eddie Murphy, and you put him in a movie where he can't talk. It's already a recipe for disaster.	2012-06-22
'A Thousand Words' is not unspeakably awful.	2012-04-21
The sort of awful formulaic crud that 30 Rock brilliantly mocked just before Leap Day.	2012-03-28
Hopelessly underwhelming from start to finish...	2012-03-28
Murphy, without the words to go along with his bug-eyed double-takes and the mugging, is lost here... He's never been a silent comic, and never will be.	2012-03-23
... equal parts labored allegory without resonance and forced comedy without laughs ...	2012-03-20
Like a bad penny, Eddie Murphy is back again, in a family-friendly PG-13 comedy that nobody wants to see.	2012-03-19
There is something almost poignant in the way Eddie Murphy so palpably desires to make a meaningful film about enlightenment. The almost comes from the difference between that aspiration and the painfully ill-conceived follow-through	2012-03-18
The idea of Murphy, that famously motormouthed actor, suddenly tongue-tied is not a punchy enough punch line to carry a whole film.	2012-03-16
This lame, wannabe comedy is an unmitigated disaster.	2012-03-15
Maybe Murphy should give future scripts a less cursory perusal.	2012-03-14
A Thousand Words ends up incomplete and disingenuous, and worse, not a frame of it is funny.	2012-03-13
Not the worst Eddie Murphy movie but certainly not his best either	2012-03-12
It isn't a horrible movie, at least not in comparison to Norbit from the same star and director, but it is a dispiritingly dull and cynical one.	2012-03-12
Sometimes it's hard to tell quite where the incisions start and stop throughout this already uneven creation.	2012-03-11
While not descending to the level of Murphy's worst work--'Pluto Nash' still stands unchallenged--it's a bland, negligible example of the 'becoming a better person through magic' scenario.	2012-03-11
Makes The Adventures of Pluto Nash look like Beverly Hills Cop!	2012-03-10
It suffers from being too broad.	2012-03-10
This high-concept Eddie Murphy vehicle is weak even by the low standards of the star's recent output.	2012-03-10
Disappointing comedy about self-reflection has sexy stuff.	2012-03-09
The last time an Eddie Murphy film was shelved for several years before release, the world got The Adventures of Pluto Nash. Don't expect anything more from this one.	2012-03-09
The high concept breeds lowbrow gags.	2012-03-09
There is a surprising sweetness and sincerity that manifests during the third act, enough to acquit the film of charges of cynicism. Its crimes against comedy, however, are not so easily forgiven.	2012-03-09
Does Eddie Murphy actually have any range, or is it just an illusion created by a few early edgy roles and, later, a lot of CGI makeup and fat suits?	2012-03-09
Eddie Murphy should have just said the word "No" to this tired, formulaic comedy.	2012-03-09
It makes you want to see Murphy team up with Judd Apatow, or even take on a dead-serious dramatic role - do anything but star in another movie like this one.	2012-03-09
Remember Eddie Murphy? He used to be hilarious.	2012-03-09
Follows directly in the footsteps of Bruce Almighty, Click, Liar Liar, Groundhog Day and any other post-Freaky Friday high-concept redemption story that inevitably crossed Tim Allen and Adam Sandler's desks at some point.	2012-03-09
another sour note in the continuing symphony which is Eddie's contemporary career irrelevance	2012-03-09
Only the most masochistic connoisseurs of the truly awful need check it out.	2012-03-09
A far cry from the Oscar winning silent film The Artist, Murphy's A Thousand Words is sadly still one too many for an audience to take in.If you waited long enough for the film to come out, then you can wait a bit longer for it to appear on TV for free.	2012-03-09
What you don't have is a funny movie.	2012-03-09
Not the least bit funny or touching, and it all goes down about as smoothly as cyanide laced with rusted nails.	2012-03-09
The idea of taking one of Hollywood's best-known motor-mouths and reducing him to mugging and charades is definitely novel - and utterly misguided.	2012-03-09
[A] mirthless excuse to watch Murphy play charades for 90 minutes.	2012-03-09
Even 2003 Robin Williams would have thunked this script in the fireplace by page 50.	2012-03-09
Even when "A Thousand Words" is counseling us to just be quiet and in the moment, it can't just be quiet and in the moment.	2012-03-09
The most incredible thing about the tree is that it also seems to have the power to turn everyone around Jack into complete idiots.	2012-03-08
In the simplicity of its premise it embodies the notion of high-concept entertainment. In its execution it demonstrates how technical efficiency can drain the life from a story.	2012-03-08
Even Murphy's largely wordless, physically adroit performance can't redeem this tortured exercise in high-concept spiritualist hokum.	2012-03-08
The concept is unoriginal, the scenarios aren't funny, and its message is banal. Plus, Murphy alternately hams it up and phones it in.	2012-03-08
A Thousand Words is not worth any more dismissive words. It needs to make like a tree and leave.	2012-03-08
A Thousand Words marks yet another lazy, "family-friendly" comedy in which Murphy phones it in -- remember when this guy was dangerously funny? -- and wastes the talents of a supporting cast that also includes Allison Janney and Jack McBrayer.	2012-03-08
Shallow performances, script and direction mute the laughs and the insights in a movie that ultimately doesn't have much to say.	2012-03-08
With "A Thousand Words," Murphy plunges headlong back into the swamp of insipid comedies he'd just crawled his way out of.	2012-03-08
A Thousand Words? I can review this ridiculously bad Eddie Murphy comedy in 500 words.	2012-03-08
In "A Thousand Words" the camera stays about two inches from Murphy's hyperactive face, and you start to see the strain and desperation in the actor's eyes.	2012-03-08
Hasn't aged well. Or do I need to say that louder, so you can hear me over your laughter at cracks about the Atkins Diet, Britney and Chili's baby-back ribs?	2012-03-08
One doesn't need to have any familiarity with the Stephanie Plum novel series to immediately hear and see what an ill fit Katherine Heigl is for the role.	2012-06-02
Light and fluffy as a cupcake, Katherine Heigl's many talents are truly wasted in this story based on the first of eighteen best-selling Stephanie Plum novels.	2012-04-03
Didn't Jennifer Aniston already do a bounty hunter movie? Talk about sloppy seconds.	2012-03-23
One For The Money is a paint-by-numbers chick-flick that'll make you laugh a few times but won't particularly enamour.	2012-03-01
Apart from the three girls behind me constantly shifting their legs so that it made my otherwise empty row feel as if I was in an earthquake, One For The Money is an utterly lifeless, joyless experience.	2012-02-29
Heigl deserves better than this.	2012-02-28
Ultimately, it's further proof that Katherine Heigl picks her projects by stapling all potential scripts to a wall and throwing a dart.	2012-02-25
The film miscasts Heigl and doesn't do much good for Debbie Reynolds as Grandma, either.	2012-02-24
Director Julie Anne Robinson never finds a convincing tone and ruins everything with over-emphatic comedy reaction shots and a music track that keeps telling us how funny everything is (it isn't).	2012-02-23
As bland and flavourless as movies come. Please God, no Two For The Show!	2012-02-23
Is there no stopping Katherine Heigl? Please.	2012-02-20
With yet another ho-hum run at the multiplexes, Katherine Heigl's big-screen resume is fast looking like an insider's gag.	2012-02-19
Heigl's fine and there's some zingy dialogue, but the violence jars with the comedy and, despite being written and directed by women, it still comes off as needlessly sexist.	2012-02-13
The supposedly feisty Plum keeps following the lead of the two hunky men in her life. Scrape off the Elmore-Leonard-lite scuzz, and this is just a retroinactive rom-com.	2012-02-09
...a second-rate and consistently worthless Out of Sight knockoff...	2012-02-04
If the filmmakers can't be bothered to believe in the real-world implications of its premise, then why ever should we?	2012-02-03
Someday to be used in film schools as a textbook example of how not to adapt a best-selling novel for the screen, One for the Money is mis-cast, mis-scripted, and mis-directed in every category.	2012-02-03
Compared to someone like Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight, Stephanie is a total drip who needs to get her head on straight before she picks up a weapon again.	2012-02-03
There seem to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 18 Stephanie Plum novels by Janet Evanoich. God save us if One for the Money catches on.	2012-02-02
Another example of a so so movie standing in the shadow of an excellent book.	2012-02-01
The dialogue isn't exactly Chandler-esque, though the stereotypes are hardboiled.	2012-01-31
Maybe it will please a few Heigl enthusiasts, but for everybody else you should avoid at all costs.	2012-01-31
An avalanche of grating big-hair-and-bad-accent New Joisey caricatures.	2012-01-30
An ungainly mix of flat-footed gumshoeing and strained attempts at hilarity, all delivered with an unconvincing Joizy vibe.	2012-01-30
Disappointing...The comedic lines penned by Evanovich, while riotously funny when read, aren't nearly as effective in the film.	2012-01-29
Inane wish fulfillment of the most dreadful variety -- a deeply vapid movie which puts no sincere care or thought into how its slapdash story choices interact with the real world.	2012-01-29
You could go nuts with the double entendres associated with One for the Money, beginning, of course, with the film's title.	2012-01-28
The movie has the by-the-numbers efficiency of a decent TV series, and about as much flavor.	2012-01-28
We're meant to laugh at the fact that cute little Stephanie bumbles her way to getting one informant killed and another savagely beaten and thrown from a moving vehicle. Oh Stephanie, you're a riot!	2012-01-28
I enjoyed it in a guilty pleasure sort of way.	2012-01-28
Lackluster bounty hunter romp has some startling violence.	2012-01-27
everything that is wrong with One for the Money is the result of Katherine Heigl	2012-01-27
There have been notable exceptions, but Heigl tends to imbue her characters with an off-putting mix of insecurity and abrasiveness. This film is a prime example.	2012-01-27
I guess I can't call the movie sexist as it was largely produced, directed and written by women. So I'll settle for calling it dull, corny and amateurish instead.	2012-01-27
It's official: Katherine Heigl will not rest until every last person on Earth is a misogynist.	2012-01-27
Katherine Heigl's self-guided descent into career irrelevance continues unabated.	2012-01-27
There is action of a sort -- a car blows up, shots are fired -- and what might pass for witty, sexy banter to someone who once overheard a conversation about an episode of Moonlighting.	2012-01-27
Heigl's comic timing is solid, and she knows her limitations well enough, but there's a hollowness at the movie's center, right where Heigl's heart should be.	2012-01-27
Imagine an Elmore Leonard movie scripted by a bad Nora Ephron imitator, and you'll have an idea of how dead-in-the-Jersey-water it is.	2012-01-27
Punitively dull.	2012-01-27
Heigl and O'Mara snipe at each other with the sizzling chemistry of two people who can't wait to whip out their BlackBerries and check their email as soon as a take is over.	2012-01-27
Everything in One for the Money rings cringingly false.	2012-01-27
Tedious and tonally inept.	2012-01-27
"One for the Money" comes across less as a fully functioning feature film and more like a busted pilot for another aggresively quirky series for the USA Network.	2012-01-27
A muddled, tonally clumsy adaptation of the first of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books.	2012-01-27
This Jersey-set movie--Heigl tries on the accent every so often, and it never fits--would be more fun with Snooki in the lead role. At least the thing would have some spunk.	2012-01-27
Janet Evanovich's best-selling Stephanie Plum series deserved better than this woefully executed, stillborn attempt at a franchise.	2012-01-27
Heigl, sporting tousled brunette locks, gives a busy, unconvincing performance.	2012-01-27
What a pity. You can see what Heigl is going for in this movie, and you can see the character she wants to play, but it doesn't come off.	2012-01-27
Fans of Evanovich's work should walk away satisfied, perhaps even delighted with the adaptation. Everyone else will simply be able to walk away, which is saying something considering the debilitating toxicity of Heigl's recent output.	2012-01-27
a celluloid own goal.	2013-10-18
No matter what kind of drab, derivative fluff you prefer, this exceptionally toothless comedy has something to offer.	2013-07-28
All the characters and their motivations are banal at best and half drawn at worst, leading to the question: why didn't this end up on The Hallmark Channel starring TV's hot-tail of the moment?	2013-03-18
... a half-hearted comedy about the perils of former professional athletes that unsuccessfully tries to force together elements of domestic melodrama and romantic farce.	2013-03-05
An own-goal shambles of bland characterization, comic shtick, exes-still-in-love cliches and lazy implausibilities, Playing For Keeps plays down to the ugliest American stereotype of soccer-dull to the point of brain-death.	2013-01-29
Did Gerard really leave the UK and a guaranteed pundit spot on Match of the Day for an automatous son and callous wife? Playing for Keeps asks difficult questions like these but provides no satisfying answers.	2013-01-06
If this was a biscuit, it would be an own-label digestive, full of sugar and trans fats - but suited and booted in a glistening wrapper.	2013-01-04
The comedy has its moments but they are few, and a high-powered cast, which also includes Judy Greer and Dennis Quaid, give mostly low-powered performances.	2013-01-04
Even the usually reliable Dennis Quaid flounders as a fellow parent in a film that is at least slickly put together but is ultimately a sheer waste of talent.	2013-01-03
In the long, ignoble tradition of naff romcoms starring Butler, this stands alongside The Ugly Truth and The Bounty Hunter as the worst of its kind.	2013-01-03
Sadly wastes its star-studded cast and has very little to offer in the way of laughs and touching moments.	2013-01-03
Even an actor as capable as Dennis Quaid is incapable of wading in to save it.	2013-01-03
Everyone involved deserves a script with more wit, originality and sense of purpose.	2012-12-26
Hitting our screens on New Year's Day, let's cross our fingers and hope that Playing for Keeps isn't an indication as to how the rest of 2013 will be for cinema. Best to get it out of the way early, I suppose!	2012-12-21
Not quite as bad as it sounds, despite the corny game plan.	2012-12-20
Rigidly formulaic and shamelessly sentimental.	2012-12-18
Dennis Quaid hammers away at a nothing role as Thurman's husband, an adulterous alpha dog; it's nearly identical to the one he played earlier this year in What to Expect When You're Expecting, but who's counting?	2012-12-14
A father-son heart-tugger wrapped around a mushy reconciliation rom-com sprinkled with tinsel of shiny Hollywood supporting stars acting like they're in another movie entirely.	2012-12-14
Garbage.	2012-12-13
Fox hasn't penned a script since 1993's So I Married an Axe Murderer, and he apparently hasn't left his home, either ...	2012-12-13
Another "almost there" film for Gerard Butler. Amazing that he is still coasting on his "300" fame.	2012-12-12
These are actors due a break. Unfortunately, this comedy-drama about a kids' soccer coach boinking a bunch of desperate housewives doesn't appear to be it.	2012-12-10
A star-studded cast and a good concept add up to less than nothing in Playing for Keeps, an attempt at a warm, family romantic comedy that, like the main character, succumbs to its vices.	2012-12-10
There's a lot of poorly-conceived plot crammed into this film, and it never actually decides what it wants to be, emerging as a disjointed story suffering from severe ADHD.	2012-12-10
Unfortunately for Butler it is another romantic comedy that misses the mark and does not score.	2012-12-09
a slow drip of a movie that refuses to make up its mind about what it wants to be as it circles the drain	2012-12-09
What could have been a more complicated and contemporary suburban spin on Alfie feels like a lazy and anonymous daydream postcard of discord and resolution.	2012-12-08
Director Gabriele Muccino can't decide whether Robbie Fox's script should be played as sex farce or heart-tugging romance - and splitting the difference is a loser both ways.	2012-12-08
George is desperate, a point hammered home when, as he's recording a sportscasting demo, his concentration is broken by a phone call from a debt collector.	2012-12-08
Like undercooked leftovers, it makes you wish they had spent a little more time getting some heat into it.	2012-12-07
It won't be up for any Oscars, nor will it score points for originality, but it's harmless enough fare for its target audience.	2012-12-07
Playing For Keeps unfolds like a metaphorical deconstruction of his charms: a meandering, formulaic look at a former sports star confronted by an uncertain future as he continues to exploit the superficial things the world still seems to want from him.	2012-12-07
Smarmy. Dopey. Sloppy. Lazy. Creepy. Tone-deaf. Predictable. Embarrassing. Lousy.	2012-12-07
It could be just the kind of pleasant surprise that leaves your inner cynic at a momentary loss for words.	2012-12-07
I'll long be haunted by Dennis Quaid's manic performance as a palm-greasing dad who seems to be under the influence of bath salts ...	2012-12-07
Another day at the Romantic Comedy Factory: '...Pull me down a Gerard Butler and a Jessica Biel, will ya?'	2012-12-07
Ho-hum sports romcom lacks both laughs and chemistry.	2012-12-07
Playing for Keeps takes place in a tonally incoherent universe, constantly shifting between rom-com farce and mawkish family drama.	2012-12-07
As the old saying goes, 'Well, that's two hours of my life I'll never get back.' Time is precious. Don't waste yours on a film like this. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2012-12-07
At this point, I'm positive Gerard Butler selects his scripts by blindfolded dart throw.	2012-12-07
At least 'Playing for Keeps' does a service for the late Rodney Dangerfield. His 'Ladybugs' is no longer the worst movie about a youth soccer coach.	2012-12-07
Soccer moms will find eye candy Gerard Butler good to look at if they can stay awake through his movie.	2012-12-07
The only thing Playing for Keeps teaches us is: Guys, forget the bars and nightclubs. Soccer moms are where the action is.	2012-12-07
Bland romantic comedy is the cinematic equivalent of processed food.	2012-12-07
A film that's pretty much from the assembly line.	2012-12-07
Another exercise in here's-the-woman-you-belong-with-and-we'll-just-delay-the-inevitable-for-90-minutes-before-you-stop-her-from-getting-on-that-plane.	2012-12-07
An undistinguished, impact-free watch-checker that will soon be vaguely distracting transatlantic travelers who forgot to carry on their iPads.	2012-12-07
Butler beware: In acting as in soccer, if you keep taking dives, sooner or later you pay the penalty.	2012-12-07
It appears to be an empty-headed piffle of a film about a dashing former professional soccer star coaching his son's team and having affairs with an assortment of randy soccer moms. And that's precisely what it is.	2012-12-07
One of those movies that comes "straight from the heart" - the heart of the hack screenwriter's manual that pushes formulaic structure to cover up a lack of compelling characters, genuine emotion or actual humor.	2012-12-07
From start to finish, the movie basks in horrible horror cliches that will leave viewers straining to find something original in the proceedings.	2013-06-30
a softball horror film, made for 13-year-old girls at a slumber party wanting to be sort of scared	2013-06-10
This new supernatural thriller by first-time director Todd Lincoln has stinker written all over it. In indelible ink.	2013-02-15
The apparition, because it's lame, spends a lot of its time tying clothes into knots, moving dressers, and opening doors.	2013-01-28
When I finally get around to writing a textbook, this is going to be one of my primary examples of how not to make a horror movie.	2012-11-30
I like a good ghost story, but 'The Apparition' is nothing like a good ghost story. It's more like a Syfy Channel show where they try to scare people in a darkened room.	2012-11-17
A thinly sketched paranormal thriller stripped almost bare of anything that might provide some color, complication or personality.	2012-11-01
The Apparition is a rare example of filmmaking failure that is so complete, it will exacerbate its audience in nearly every way possible.	2012-10-02
Every fo paux The Apparition commits stems from a general atmosphere lacking any vibrant heartbeat, creating characters and conflicts which are tragically birthed on life support.	2012-09-13
Todd Lincoln, in his directorial debut, shows the restraint of a young Val Lewton. Things go bad oh-so-slowly ...	2012-09-02
This horror movie from Warner Bros. is nothing special, but it's nice to see a modest genre entertainment buoyed by a major studio's resources.	2012-08-31
When you look into this abyss, it yawns back at you.	2012-08-31
Plants wither and furniture is rearranged, as if the demon were an inconsiderate housesitter.	2012-08-31
The whole ordeal only lasts 82 minutes, but that's still too long for a film with no ambition aside from lightening your wallet.	2012-08-29
Doesn't offer anything new, let alone entertaining.	2012-08-29
The entity is a ghostly presence amid an even ghostlier absence. This is truly distressed real estate.	2012-08-29
A run of the mill horror flick that gets worse and worse as it progresses	2012-08-28
Something lacking either body heat or visceral suspense.	2012-08-28
It's simply one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen in my life; such a waste of time being in that theater. It's so wholly awful it's almost an acheivement how bad it is.	2012-08-27
For casual viewers desiring a few scares, some suspense and a sustained sense of dread and malevolence, you could do worse.	2012-08-26
Lights flicker; soap and cactuses blacken; claw marks appear; icky molds gather like hornet nests.	2012-08-26
Might give you a restless night, but only because you fell asleep in the theater.	2012-08-26
The Apparition is not a great or even good haunted-house movie, but it does have the advantage of a memorable setting.	2012-08-26
Abysmally dreadful! One of the worst miscalculations of the year.	2012-08-26
Between Lincoln's ineptitude and the vacant prettiness of Greene and Stan, "The Apparition" becomes just a pile of false starts and dead ends that never build to anything truly frightening.	2012-08-25
Scary bad.	2012-08-25
The Apparition takes a potential paranormal romp and robs it of its purpose.	2012-08-25
...one of those late summer time-wasters that - like the film's spirit - appears out of nowhere, hopes to grab you (or, at least, your wallet) and then vanish again.	2012-08-24
The bare-bones framework of an utterly generic horror story, devoid of thrills, jolts or even an interesting hook.	2012-08-24
'Apparition' is unfocused and overdeveloped. [It's] bogged down with heavy exposition, lack of rules, and a lackluster performance from Sebastian Stan.	2012-08-24
What actually happens in the movie seems to be left over from some kind of rigorous cutting session. It's less of an arc than a flatline.	2012-08-24
If you enjoy laughing at bad movies with friends, then sure, have a good time watching it this weekend. Otherwise, stay away.	2012-08-24
There's a whole new genre of scary movies that might more accurately be called borey movies.	2012-08-24
The movie loses goodwill early on by killing an adorable dog, resulting in a lack of an identification point, since the canine has better intuition than the humans.	2012-08-24
The soulless-ness of their empty plot of track homes and super-store existence invokes both Poltergeist and Employee of the Month.	2012-08-24
The only thing scary about this DOA horror attempt is that it ever got made.	2012-08-24
Mild scares and a go-nowhere climax haunt this suburbs-set debut.	2012-08-24
If you listen closely enough while things go bump in the night during The Apparition, you might also hear the scraping of barrel bottoms.	2012-08-24
The story is a worthy one, but the film lacks any daring expressive touches that might have made it, at the very least, noteworthy.	2012-08-24
Everything ends with Kelly back at the Costco where they bought their tent and one keeps hoping for the guys from "The Watch" to pop in to liven things up. Or Sigourney Weaver from "Red Lights" to expose the fraud. "The Apparition" is simply abysmal.	2012-08-24
An incomprehensibly garbled, derivative attempt at a horror flick from first-time writer-director Todd Lincoln.	2012-08-24
It's a potentially creepy setting that would give an innovative director a chance to do a lot with a little. Unfortunately, Lincoln isn't one of those.	2012-08-24
One of the most boring horror movies of all time.	2012-08-24
Wafts out of the ether like the ghosts of bad movies past, the very picture of the cinema's dog days of August.	2012-08-24
Just about the most basic and generic haunted house retread in several years. Aggressively dull stuff.	2012-08-24
80 minutes of generic jump scares involving generic people who are largely to blame for their generic problems.	2012-08-24
The shortest flick this summer is also one of the worst, a ghastly ghost story that fails to deliver its generic goods on any level.	2012-08-24
It's just more of the same old, same old haunted house style material we've seen countless times before, and usually far better than what's offered here. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2012-08-24
May run just 82 minutes (and that includes drawn-out final credits), but the picture's brevity can't hide what a toothless waste of potential it all is.	2012-08-24
The good news is that it only clocks in at a mere 74 minutes before the end credits kick in. The bad news is that it makes viewers work for every single one before they can stumble to the lobby to figure out what the hell it was that they just watched.	2012-08-23
While director Nicole Kassall tried to create an independent female lead who doesn't give into stereotypes with Marley, the overall movie ultimately lacked originality, a memorable story and characters with any true purpose.	2012-09-17
Director Nicole Kassell is completely out of her element here.	2012-06-13
For those who have a lot of time to waste	2012-05-15
Sap without the weight of reality, awkwardly combined with a romance without much chemistry.	2012-05-08
Bizarre combo of terminal cancer weepy and sexy romcom.	2012-05-07
An overdose of sentimentality that ends up being painful to watch.	2012-05-06
A little bit of hell.	2012-05-04
It's hard to develop much empathy for the characters in the final reel when everything leading to that point rings so emotionally false.	2012-05-04
Although New Orleans sparkles as the film's setting, the story boasts too many moving and mismatched parts to resonate in any sort of meaningful way.	2012-05-04
In A Little Bit of Heaven, Hudson pushes the "Just Die Already" meter straight into the red.	2012-05-04
Kate Hudson dies prettily in this tone-deaf dramedy about a woman finding love while suffering from colon cancer.	2012-05-04
When a movie opens with a character telling you that love isn't important, that movie is definitely going to smack down that nonbeliever, because movies always believe love is important.	2012-05-04
This movie turns into a total bummerfest that isn't sad enough to make me cry or funny enough to make me giggle.	2012-05-04
Who knew dying could be such a laugh riot? Certainly not any of us who have actually watched a loved one in the awful final stages of cancer.	2012-05-04
In the long history of bad movies about bad illnesses, "A Little Bit of Heaven" just might be the worst.	2012-05-03
Gren Wells' screenplay throws around a few ideas about female independence and sexuality, but finally it's as shallow as it is mawkish.	2012-05-03
A cringe-inducing romantic comedy turned cancer tragedy turned inspirational hosanna about living in the moment, embracing your bliss and other cliches.	2012-05-03
Who's got time for bed-rest when there are hang-gliding lessons to be had?	2012-05-03
The film reaches into the pits of moviegoing hell when it finds Marley on a celestial white couch, ringed in billowing white curtains, communing with God. And God is embodied by Whoopi Goldberg.	2012-05-03
A moment of silence, please, for Kate Hudson's career.	2012-05-03
There is nothing the slightest bit heavenly about this project, which is wrong-headed in just about every department.	2012-05-03
Unsurprisingly for a film detailing terminal disease, this is a largely solemn affair, often verging on morbidity in its elongated death watch.	2012-05-03
Sending Marley an escort who is a little person for comic effect represents a major foul; the guy saying people call him 'a little bit of heaven' is hitting the ball backwards out of the stadium.	2012-05-03
Bravely or stupidly, both A Little Bit Of Heaven and its heroine charge on as if the introduction of terminal cancer didn't change things that much.	2012-05-03
As embodied with clueless good humor by Kate Hudson, fatal sickness looks more like a lifestyle and wardrobe choice than a tragedy.	2012-05-02
Colon cancer isn't a great pretext for uplift or an occasion for Bucket List-style hang gliding, snappy dream-sequence banter with Whoopi Goldberg as God and a brief comic bit featuring Peter Dinklage as an escort.	2012-05-01
A Little Bit of Heaven demands miracles of its cast to keep proceedings from becoming grindingly mawkish and does not get them...	2012-05-01
What's missing is honesty. It has been supplanted by artifice.	2012-05-01
A romantic comedy about cancer. I've officially seen it all.	2012-04-05
As a cancer drama it is insultingly sickly sweet, as a comedy it's lazily written and executed, and as a romance it is void of chemistry and passion.	2012-03-03
Peter Dinklage is the surprise package in this mash up . . . in which his role of an escort with a reputation to deliver 'a little bit of heaven' brings a welcome lift and unexpected honesty to a film that crumbles under its own weight and aspirations	2012-02-25
Kate Hudson's career suicide continues with the devastatingly unfunny, tonally jarring A Little Bit of Heaven.	2011-12-31

Hudson wastes her opportunity to add more depth to her acting CV, while Bernal is not the right fit as a romantic lead.	2011-09-01
Shot in the style of a bland Hollywood rom-com, this film is actually a weepie drama with a bit of magical realism thrown in. It's such an odd hybrid that we're never sure whether we should laugh or cry. So we do neither.	2011-04-04
There are certainly moments to enjoy here, and there is no denying Kate Hudson's charm and enthusiasm.	2011-04-04
I had no idea colon cancer was so much fun!... It is so fantastic to be dying! Call it the Ass Cancer Life Plan. Every modern girl needs it.	2011-02-10
Manages to be both weird and boring.	2011-02-07
Rest assured I'm not going to give the game away as to whether Marley beats the disease. But given the movie's set in New Orleans - a place famous for its funerals - I wouldn't hold your breath.	2011-02-07
A Little Bit of Heaven is not a film that I would ever commend to the ill, the well or to anyone in that grey area between.	2011-02-07
Bernal who, physically, just looks rather mismatched next to Hudson on screen ... For such an accomplished actor, he just comes across as more 'dud than stud' in this.	2011-02-06
What's to like? Not much.	2011-02-04
About as morbid and schlocky a romcom as you can imagine.	2011-02-03
This film is one long biopsy of pure horror: the tumours of sentimentality and bad acting metastasise everywhere, and Bernal, in particular, is horrendously bad.	2011-02-03
Jaw-droppingly mawkish and offensively trivial about confronting one's mortality.	2011-02-03
Hudson struggles to strike the balance between comedy and tragedy, and she and Bernal share little chemistry.	2011-02-03
Poorly directed, ill-conceived, hideously unfunny romcom-slash-disease-of-the-week movie...	2011-02-02
A Little Bit Of Heaven makes you ask some really big questions. The biggest is why anyone involved in this film thought any of it was a good idea.	2011-02-02
A cynical affair only suited to those who like a cheap, forgettable weep.	2011-02-02
The emotional breakthroughs are clearly signposted, as if you can feel the filmmaker's hand while she slowly winds our heartstrings around her little finger.	2011-02-02
A poorly-directly and terribly-executed mess of a motion picture that should have been left in the dark.	2013-06-30
An unnecessary but inoffensive espionage thriller that you have to assume was an inch away from going straight to DVD.	2013-01-22

Sigourney Weaver, who last year suffered the indignity of backing up Taylor Lautner -- Taylor Lautner, for God's sake -- in the daft Abduction, now finds herself essaying the role of the villain in another action flick that's nearly as dopey.	2012-09-14

[Weaver is] the only one having any fun - and that includes the audience.	2012-09-11
A perfunctory chase movie that drops in its tracks long before it reaches what's supposed to pass for a rousing climax.	2012-09-10
The script throws around phrases like "intel," "terrorist" and "rogue operative," but as time bombs go, the briefcase-versus-loved-ones ultimatum barely ticks.	2012-09-10
Rather than defining those twists and turns with sharp punctuation, director Mabrouk El Mechri turns them into gentle speed bumps, making the film barely interesting rather than exhilarating	2012-09-09
Charging $10 for this movie is criminal; vouchers and letters of apology should be handed out at the exit for those stalwart viewers who stick it out to the end.	2012-09-09

This isn't great cinema, or even a movie you'll remember four hours later, but as stupid thrill rides go, it's smart enough to show you a good time.	2012-09-07
Simply put, "Day" is a mess Cavill never rises above.	2012-09-07
If there's anything positive to glean from Cold Light, it would have to be its use as an educational tool, teaching young film students how not to make a mid-budget action movie.	2012-09-07
It exists basically as a long showreel for Superman-to-be Henry Cavill, who gets to demonstrate a mastery of run-with-a-gun acting and flex his leading man charisma without really breaking a sweat.	2012-09-06

[A] workmanlike slice of sub-Bourne hijinks...	2012-04-12
From the outset, The Cold Light of Day purports to be nothing more than a by-the-numbers action thriller. What's shocking is how it manages to take this predictable-but-sturdy template and sell it short.	2012-04-12
There's the usual mixture of flying tables and chairs and various scrapes here and there while unknown director Mabrouk El Mechri tries to remember what he was supposed to be doing with the plot.	2012-04-11
It all boils down to a series of riotously extended showdowns between Cavill and Weaver...	2012-04-10

The Devil Inside is a con job; a fraud of a movie that leads audiences to the singularly most unsatisfying ending to a movie I've seen in my 13 years as a movie critic.	2013-03-01
An exposition-heavy opening act and an abrupt lack of closure may leave moviegoers feeling underserved by The Devil Inside's few genuinely scary moments.	2012-10-01
horror that tries to shock you as many times as possible, rather than tell you a story.	2012-08-30

If it's January, it must be low-grade horror season.	2012-03-23
And in a wretched attempt to make this contrivance 'real', they resort to endless shaking of the camera. (You would love to shake them!) The only possession I was looking for in this devilish drivel was the possession of any kind of filmmaking talent.	2012-03-22
Just terrible.	2012-03-21
A run-of-the-mill exorcism movie hobbled by its own hype and a divisive ending.	2012-03-19
The Devil Inside is yet another dull found footage effort with nothing, bar a mad climax, to offer audiences.	2012-03-19
Another abysmal horror movie based around "found" documentary footage.	2012-03-19
The Devil Inside has the occasional creepy moment but it's let down by a patchy script and some uneven performances.	2012-03-17
Exorcism horror gets the cliched shaky-camera treatment in this chiller...	2012-03-15
If you are a novice this kind of material is suitably spooky. To the veteran, less so.	2012-03-13
Some found footage should really just stay lost.	2012-03-11
at best a placeholder for better films, and a reminder that gimmicks - be they technical or narrative - will get a filmmaker only so far.	2012-03-10
The less said about THAT ending, the better. But as a brief, brutal and nasty vignette showing the naked weirdness of an "authentic" exorcism, it's not sooo bad.	2012-03-04
While the Devil might have a claim to hold all the best tunes, on the evidence of this, he really needs a word with his film development department.	2012-03-02
A low-budget, low-watt belly botherer saved from history's dustbin by a few gruesome moments and a gob-smack of an ending that (almost) makes it worth the slog.	2012-02-20
To pad the running time, the end credits roll at a snail's pace; they do reveal the interesting fact that the possessed woman's 'contortionist double' is one 'Pixie Le Knot.'	2012-01-23
Call it The Blair Exorcist Project ...	2012-01-20
Gentle reader, be prepared for a shock."The Devil Inside" is pure fiction. I know about the advertising campaign and that it's supposed to be based on a true story, but it's not. It has a screenwriter, director and everything, even professional actors.	2012-01-16
It's not just a dull, witless, horror film, it's also an incredibly lazy one.	2012-01-14
From the amateur acting, writing and directing to an ending that is shocking only in its stupidity, The Devil Inside will make you puke for all the wrong reasons.	2012-01-13
A non-scary movie possessed by badness.	2012-01-13
Another feature to remind us all just how brilliant The Exorcist was back in '73 and how almost every possession flick since has paled by comparison.	2012-01-12
Makes you appreciate what an excellently made movie "The Exorcist" was	2012-01-10
[A] limp mockumentary.	2012-01-10
It stumbles along to what may arguably be the most abrupt, nonsensical ending since Luis Bunuel stopped slicing cows' eyes for the sake of surrealism.	2012-01-10
It's a supernatural, satanic stunt - and, judging by its astonishing grosses, it won't be the last of its kind.	2012-01-10
A non-starter that could have been at least a good B-grade horror flick if it had been made with little more conviction.	2012-01-10
Suggests at least this much: the race for Worst Film of the Year is going to be extremely competitive.	2012-01-09
This is how the world ends: not with a bang or a whimper but with a URL.	2012-01-09
"The Devil Inside'' usefully reminds us how little it takes to make some people scream in a crowded movie theater.	2012-01-07
For most of the running time this demon pic amps up the blurry shots and loud booming screams to signify well, not much.	2012-01-07
"The Vatican doesn't endorse this film or its completion," are the first words to appear on the blank screen that begins this film. Having sat through it, I don't endorse it, either.	2012-01-07
People of the world: If you find some footage, leave it be. You will likely be doing the rest of us a huge favor.	2012-01-07
The Devil Inside's biggest shock arrives when it abruptly ends - just as it hits its stride.	2012-01-07
Despite a handful of fine freak-outs, this exorcise routine rarely elevates the heart rate. And its contemptuous conclusion offers a compelling case for euthanizing the found-footage genre altogether.	2012-01-06
According to the advertisements, the Vatican did not endorse The Devil Inside. Smart move, Vatican. It's not that it's a terrible movie. It's just a stupid movie.	2012-01-06
Welcome to the freak show. "The Devil Inside" has everything you would expect from an R-rated horror movie about demon possession: creepy demon voices, contorted bodies, bloody murders and priests who actually think they have a chance of defeating Satan.	2012-01-06
It must be January. The s****y exorcist movies are in bloom.	2012-01-06
The film devolves into a kind of exorcism-themed Real World episode, replete with "confessionals" in which the characters tearfully air their frustrations. As if we cared.	2012-01-06
Whatever possessed Bell & Co. to turn a slow-burning creepfest into a frenzied freak show of multiple exorcisms (including one in a moving car), the devil only knows.	2012-01-06
You can see where this is going, and the filmmakers can see that you can see. So they rush to the hideous yet hilarious climax in little more than an hour and then pad the running time with the slowest-moving credits ever.	2012-01-06
The "fake documentary horror film" genre seems to have totally run its course, creativity-wise.	2012-01-06
While it doesn't exactly reinvent the inverted cross, The Devil Inside definitely puts a nifty indie spin on the demonic possession genre.	2012-01-06
Clearly, when a cheapie pickup like "Paranormal Activity," which Paramount released a few years ago, turns into franchise gold, there's just no stopping the banality.	2012-01-06
Wants to appeal to the fan base of Broken Lizard desperately, but also wants to service the audience that loves movies from Garry Marshall or Rob Reiner...	2013-01-07
The screenwriters started with a great premise and then ran out of ideas, abandoning the more risky, inventive procreation comedy for corny slapstick	2012-10-02
What starts as an insightful, bracingly straight-spoken comedy about infertility falls apart in the final act when it diverts into a wacky, under-developed adventure	2012-10-02
A romcom that fumbles for heart in the gutter, and finds only glib gags.	2012-10-01
Some funny moments but not many, despite decent playing from Mann and Schneider.	2012-09-28
It actually gets more stupid the more you think about it.	2012-09-27
The plot is content to stay at surface level, never truly working for big laughs when easy ones can be grasped instead.	2012-09-12
Made me laugh, made me care and didn't insult my intelligence. It's almost as fun as making a baby yourself.	2012-08-21
A film of limited effort, slowly sealing off its potential the longer it lingers on lackluster comedy in a manner that's become habitual to Chandrasekhar and his cronies.	2012-08-16
In short, the movie's not funny enough or serious-minded enough to warrant 95 minutes of your time.	2012-08-11
Preposterous, inane and silly, but outrageously funny.	2012-08-07
The sole function served by this motion picture is to illustrate how not to frame jokes in movies.	2012-08-05
The only moments where The Babymakers provides any kind of comic lift come when talented improvisers like Faxon, Heffernan, Chandrasekhar and Aisha Tyler clearly go off-book and noodle their way into something that's actually amusing.	2012-08-03
'The Babymakers' is so uninspired it's depressing.	2012-08-03
Crude, mostly unimaginative comedy is meant for adults.	2012-08-03
"The Babymakers" is amazing in its complete lack of comedy, nearly satirical in its rejection of levity and full-on embrace of mediocrity.	2012-08-03
Mostly The Babymakers coasts lazily along on the likability of the cast and the occasional amusing moment.	2012-08-03
When a movie resorts to scenes of a grown man rolling around on a floor slick with spilled semen samples, something plainly has gone wrong.	2012-08-03
Every so often a movie comes along that's so lame, you can almost make out a "What the hell am I doing here?" thought bubble over an actor's head.	2012-08-03
It nearly perfects the concept of an idiot plot.	2012-08-02
The big disappointment of "The Babymakers" is that it doesn't come close to being worthy of its two stars, Paul Schneider and Olivia Munn.	2012-08-02
Viewers may suspect the filmmakers have no clue about the actual operation of fertility clinics and sperm banks (the plot depends on some pretty dubious practices, particularly involving donor anonymity), but most will be laughing too hard to care.	2012-08-02
You know Chandrasekhar is half-invested when even a montage of blows to the crotch (with each hit a potential cause of our hero's "lazy sperm") feels completely phoned in.	2012-08-02
Yet another attempt to mix raunchy excess and romantic-comedy sweetness in an anything-goes raucous farce, The Babymakers offers a few big laughs between ho-hum stretches of frenetic vamping.	2012-08-02
Ah, infertility comedies - always such a good time. You remember the way you yukked it up at "Maybe Baby" and "A Smile Like Yours," don't you? Oh, wait, you don't? Exactly.	2012-08-02
"The Babymakers" has a stronger narrative arc than Broken Lizard's previous films, but that doesn't better serve the gross-out sight gags or the flat one-liners.	2012-08-02
How does a comedy troupe even get from the frat-humor antics of "Beerfest" to the middle-class suburbanality of "Babymakers"?	2012-08-02
The protagonist is sterile. Not to mention the filmmakers' imagination.	2012-08-02
Some raunchy laughs here, but this is mostly a strained heist film marred by the director's decision to cast himself in a major, cringe-worthy role.	2012-08-02
Delivered with sloppy, gleeful confidence, the movie is smarter than most gross-out comedies but isn't afraid to inspire an "Ewww."	2012-08-02
Even those with the lowest enjoyment threshold for knuckle-dragging comedies will be hard-pressed to find joy in this impotent misfire from director Jay Chandrasekhar.	2012-08-02
A movie to flee from with an agonized shriek.	2012-08-02
Just how much does sperm amuse you?	2012-08-02
It's raunchy/sweet in the American Pie/40-Year-Old Virgin tradition, and as dynamic as a glob of lazy sperm.	2012-08-02
Although I am aware sperm is a precious bodily fluid, I don't find it an especially funny one, and when a character spills half of the deposits in a sperm bank and then slips around on the floor like a clown on ice, I'm not laughing.	2012-08-02
Munn, sexy and spirited, plays Audrey as a woman without much patience for arrested-male shenanigans. You may end up feeling the same way.	2012-08-01
...this is one of the most technically inept movies I've seen in quite some time...	2012-08-01
Poorly conceived and executed, the film wastes the talents of Paul Schneider in a series of silly and embarrassing situations.	2012-08-01
An increasingly incredulously plotted series of embarrassments about the wounded masculinity of a low sperm count.	2012-08-01
Munn has proved on TV that she has solid timing, but she does little here other than look pretty and, when the plot calls for it, outraged.	2012-07-31
Its 95 minutes feel like a trimester...	2012-07-31
Things you do to yourself with one hand: That's a running theme in this movie and, really, the perfect metaphor for the film itself.	2012-07-31
A safe, laugh-free exercise that gets to have its fun, such as it is, because it's all in the service of the most conservative notions of domestic normality.	2012-07-29
Olivia Munn is fun to look and, but you'd never guess at how talented Paul Schneider really is from the looks of this comic travesty.	2012-07-25
Broad humor has served Chandrasekhar and his clan in the past, but this is a project that should have been aborted on the cover page once he read as far as 'by Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow.'	2012-03-28
Chandrasekhar's first tentative venture towards something slightly more sincere is undermined by his irresistible urge to take the piss out of every sequence that might have been played even remotely seriously	2012-03-11
	2013-01-22

	2013-01-22
	2013-01-22
It's made for - and presumably by - people who haven't ever seen a horror movie. What's even more frustrating is that its inherent ineptitude doesn't ever become entertaining in a "this is hilariously horrible" fashion.	2013-11-25
Ninety minutes of melodrama for ten minutes of a very derivative surprise ending.	2013-06-20
A clunky, run-of-the-mill horror flick written by the same guy who penned last year's similarly themed disappointment, Dream House.	2013-02-15
It isn't very scary, but it does pile a bunch of really tasteless twists on towards the end that make no sense and it almost becomes a comedy. On one hand, is a failure as a horror film, but as an exercise in desperation, it's kind of a hoot	2013-01-16
exactly what you'd expect from a PG-13 horror movie dropped in September. There's really nothing particularly scary about it, and the story ranges from shaky to thin	2013-01-14
House at the End of the Street reveals itself to be merely another forgettable PG-13 thriller banking on the brain-dead mall crowd to tweet their unending love for a crummy feast such as this.	2012-10-19
The screenplay has a nice twist that could have supported a stylish giallo-style thriller; unfortunately, director Mark Tonderai delivers a mess -- an almost random tangle of choppy edits, handheld camera, 'shock' sound effects and other horror cliches.	2012-10-09
Formulaic, unoriginal suspense thriller aided by a plot twist and good leads, that might delight the less-gore-is-more teenage audience.	2012-10-05
A routine 'Don't go down to the basement' thriller, but watching Jennifer Lawrence go through her paces makes it enjoyable.	2012-09-29
The filmmakers elect to emphasize every plot point and telegraph every plot twist with the delicacy of a train blaring its horn as it approaches a crossing -- and yet that isn't even their greatest sin.	2012-09-29
Borrows so liberally from other movies that it could have been fascinating, but due to confused direction and a mishmash of acting, it's ultimately bland and forgettable.	2012-09-28
Lawrence is fine as the solo-parented teen and Thieriot does a mean Tony Perkins (circa Pretty Poison, but on downers), but the sheer tedium of the storyline means you never really care about any of them.	2012-09-28
[T]he scariest thing about [this] is that this sort of junk is considered a good career move for a young actress who's just come off a small film from a respected indie director...	2012-09-27
Saying that House at the End of the Street is contrived is an insult to contrivances.	2012-09-27
Shockingly uneventful, this horror film marks time until dropping its big, dumb reveal.	2012-09-25
... Typical of modern horror movies, jump-scares (which are startling, not scary--there is a difference) sprinkled throughout deflate the suspense before it builds much.	2012-09-25
Clearly designed as a downbeat, character-driven psychological thriller, not a shock machine...but it never really pays off, in part because it relies too often on the very cliches it aspires to avoid.	2012-09-24
Don't be tempted to put in an offer; this house is built on flimsy foundations.	2012-09-24
You've seen every twist and turn before and it's all played completely straight. A Scream-esque knowing wink would make it all far more palatable.	2012-09-24
Its talented lead is reduced to being just another scantily clad babe getting stalked by a psycho.	2012-09-23
A "sleepover night" horror movie made for young people who haven't seen many good horror movies.	2012-09-23
This is the type of run of the mill, cookie cutter, PG-13, piss poor excuse of a horror movie that horror fans always complain about over the internet.	2012-09-22
A choppily edited, poorly timed mess with little continuity, overloaded with aural shocks in a desperate attempt to compensate for its minimal suspense.	2012-09-22
Tonderai steers the story cleanly around its queasy hairpin turns, perversely toying with one of pop cinema's most cherished cliches: the audience's inculcated desire to side with the underdog.	2012-09-22
Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue are trapped in this banal, formulaic, low-budget horror thriller.	2012-09-22
There are one or two clever plot twists that are subsequently followed up by a cavalcade of ridiculous, credibility-stretching ones.	2012-09-21
You can tell Lawrence knows she's in a lost cause. Her performance is often rendered in one disinterested facial expression.	2012-09-21
What could be so bad about a new Jennifer Lawrence movie that its distributor opts to keep it away from critics and release it with minimal ad support? Please, allow "House at the End of the Street" to answer that question.	2012-09-21
This is the rare horror film so bad you almost wish it had turned into a good old connect-the-gory-dots slasher movie. The only mystery at work is how Lawrence's agent ever let her sign on.	2012-09-21
Goes flat and generic, substituting jump-scares and visual twitchiness for the psychological complexity that might have sold the horror.	2012-09-21
I hope Lawrence takes some time today to hug her Catching Fire producers for her good fortune.	2012-09-21
Originality, or lack thereof, isn't really the movie's problem. Execution is.	2012-09-21
There's nothing original at all about House at the End of the Street, yet another ineffective, training-wheels-attached, PG-13 horror movie.	2012-09-21
Not even Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence's presence can hold your attention while you wait for her to complete the paint-by-numbers steps you already created in your head for this retread.	2012-09-21
A schlockly spin on the girl-in-jeopardy genre.	2012-09-21
Feisty girl + troubled young man + house full of ugly secrets = hackneyed horror movie you've seen a hundred times before, even if Jennifer Lawrence keeps it watchable.	2012-09-21
All the condescension of a Lifetime Original Movie and only half the ironic entertainment value.	2012-09-21
House at the End of the Street is what it is: a teenage version of Fatal Attraction (1987) with a dash of The Collector (1965).	2012-09-21
House at the End of the Street is a thoroughly awful and unpleasant horror film, one that attempts to affect its unlucky audience by trading in abuse, sadism, and general human misery. It is a dreadful experience.	2012-09-21
By the third act, you or someone sitting near you will be whispering, muttering or just plain shouting at the screen.	2012-09-21
Bland, bloodless babysitter bait.	2012-09-21
The movie requires the characters to act stupidly to help move things forward, and if they had seen any other movies, they would know not to do these things.	2012-09-21
A soulless, uncreative, cliche-laden anger generator disguised as a horror thriller, Mark Tonderai's film undermines itself at every turn and infuriates its audience.	2012-09-21
Like a street shyster looking to make a score with a shell game, the director keeps trying to play with your expectations. Unfortunately, you're likely to end up feeling ripped off.	2012-09-21
While its not bad-bad, it's just so poorly conceived that it should have premiered on Lifetime...It very well may be the most generic horror film ever made.	2012-09-21
This PG-13 scare-fest is more psychological terror than blood and guts, and should satisfy-not repulse-young genre fans.	2012-09-21
This convoluted psychological thriller unravels as it should be tightening.	2012-09-21
The film is essentially toothless, but it never stoops to humorless torture-porn theatrics.	2012-09-21
A thriller with a twisted ending that feels clumsy, laboured and unconvincing throughout.	2012-09-21
Though The House at the End of the Street is smarter than most films of the genre, it still has some fairly predictable plot turns.	2012-09-21
$90,000,000, a hundred, whatever they spent: this is a taut thriller built for audiences but also one of the most expensive experimental movies ever made. It's a thrill ride, but a work by a visual artist at the extremes of his acuity.	2014-04-08
The fact that the film touches on spiritual themes at all is worth noting, and makes this film just a little bit more than the thrill ride that all the ads have promised.	2014-03-26
An escape from the past that is simultaneously a flight to no future.	2014-03-04
One of the best science fiction movies in years.	2014-03-02
This is a story about people floating through space, and Alfonso Cuaron's feature brilliantly contrives to make the viewer feel similarly untethered, to often thrilling effect. This is surely the closest cinema comes to three-dimensional virtual abseiling.	2014-03-02
The single most stressful two hours you can have in a movie theatre - in the best possible way.	2014-02-07
Surely there are Oscar nominations for all involved, and Gravity is set to be a classic.	2014-02-07
What could easily have been a dull practice in CGI is crafted by Alfonso Cuaron in to a journey for survival and learning how to cherish life...	2014-02-06
For all the complicated CG wizardry and ostensibly visionary gloss...[Gravity] is aesthetically and structurally regressive.	2014-02-05
We've seen films set in outer space before, but nothing has ever felt this real.	2014-01-22
A sleek, smooth, immersive, and rather overwhelming spectacle of economy, efficiency, and all-around proficiency.	2014-01-11
One of the ten best films of 2013.	2014-01-07
If Cuaron's long-gestating thriller is perhaps not quite the masterpiece we were hoping for, it is still a thrilling and visually striking work.	2014-01-02
A marvel of performance and effect utilizing the man against his environment/survival motif to justify visual and technical elegance and brilliance.	2013-12-31
You want to admire the technical achievement, except it never feels like a technical achievement. It just feels like you're there. And desperately want to leave.	2013-12-30
This masterpiece perfectly blends the elements of a science fiction blockbuster- A-list stars and amazing special effects- with a powerful and subtle story.	2013-12-24
Cuaron's knack for long takes amplifies the terror, where devastation approaches without a sound and that thump you hear could very well be your own pulse.	2013-12-23
It's a technical marvel -- appropriately breathtaking in its evocation of space's vastness and the buffeting suffered by the two astronauts in their efforts to anchor themselves to something solid. But Cuaron also knows how suspense works.	2013-12-18
Gravity is, in the end, a perfect melding of the technological and the emotional.	2013-12-18
An absolute technical marvel in every way possible -- from cinematography to special effects to sound design to score, all of Gravity's technical parts work together in perfect harmony for maximum effectiveness.	2013-12-18
Cuaron crucially knows how to deliver spectacle in a way that still counts -- and at a time when practically anything that can be imagined on the page can now be realised on screen, that's no mean feat.	2013-12-18
I was on the edge of my seat.	2013-12-18
Despite these flaws, Gravity is an amazing experience.	2013-12-18
Gravity asks that you think about these more lasting effects. And for that, and despite its distractions, its sad mother, its astronauts and ham radio connections, the movie is gorgeous and moving, more about possibility than credibility.	2013-12-17
A modern science-fiction classic that follows a fractured mother struggling to find herself in the vastness of space.	2013-12-15
Bullock's almost balletic performance imbues this vertiginous fantasy with a humanity and grace that beautifully complements director Alfonso Cuaron's breathtaking vision.	2013-12-09
With Hollywood recycling and "rebooting" the same stories and sights more than ever, Gravity stands out as a spectacle not to be missed.	2013-11-27
That is probably one of the best acted, most visually stunning adventure films ever.	2013-11-20
Can one smell bull**** in space?	2013-11-12
Gravity resembles a cutting-edge video game more than it does a wholeheartedly immersive cinematic experience...	2013-11-12
Created through a painstaking combination of physical and digital performance that disintegrates the divide between live action and animation, Gravity boasts a level of sheer visual invention that would have left Stanley Kubrick's head spinning.	2013-11-11
Jaw-dropping wonder, dizzying vertigo, heart-stopping tension, spine-tingling shocks and visceral fear: Gravity stimulates them all... Bullock's vital signs [are] being monitored; that probably wouldn't be a bad idea for the viewer, too.	2013-11-09
A nail-biting journey that's as nerve-wracking as it is technically impressive.	2013-11-08
The plot is one-track, the cast minimal and the pace leisurely. But it's a real pleasure to experience space in a movie without an alien in sight.	2013-11-08
One can easily imagine Robert Louis Stevenson or H Rider Haggard getting a kick out of Gravity.	2013-11-08
More like a 91-minute thrill-ride than an astronaut adventure movie, this tour de force throws us out into space without a safety line then thrills us with a series of near misses that take our breath away.	2013-11-08
Stunningly accomplished space survival adventure: heartstopping and heartbreaking; the best film of 2013 so far. Just don't call it science fiction.	2013-11-08
In space no one can hear you scream. No one can hear your jaw drop either.	2013-11-07
It's a bumpy trip, with two voyagers carrying, some will argue, excess charisma baggage. But it's a trip no space spectacle fan should miss.	2013-11-07
Gripping and utterly immersive space thriller with awe-inspiring visuals, state-of-the-art special effects, unmissable 3D work and a terrific central performance from Sandra Bullock.	2013-11-07
The film looks and feels so real you have to remind yourself virtually everything on screen doesn't actually exist.	2013-11-07
Everyone in for a unique cinematic ride against the backdrop of the abyss of outer space will have a fantastic time.	2013-11-07
Director and co-writer Cuaron brilliantly manages to create both awe at his glorious space vistas, and knuckle-gobbling tension at what's happening in the foreground.	2013-11-07
Finally the 3D film to knock your socks off. Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is a spectacular watch, which leaves you with a jaw dropping, head spinning, truly immersive space experience.	2013-11-07
The film of the year.	2013-11-04
a masterpiece of both action and psychology	2013-11-03
Like the title suggests, this is an astronaut adventure whose pull is hard to resist. By the time 90 stomach-shrinking minutes have elapsed, you'll feel like you've been bumped around the heavens.	2013-11-01
I would hate to make Gravity sound like nothing more than a technical achievement. The film does have a theme, and uses the marvels of its imagery to drive that meaning home.	2013-10-31
Keeps the tension at white-knuckle levels, evoking the paradoxically claustrophobic emptiness of space as the astronaut faces dangers intimate (asphyxiation) and existential (the void).	2013-10-27
Revolutionary in style and scope and one of the most audience-immersive films ever made.	2013-10-25
Ejiofor's low-key, naturalistic acting mode is ideal for conveying Northup's self-control and intelligence. And Fassbender avoids turning the malevolent Epps into a one-note nemesis.	2014-04-28
McQueen works from ferocity to felicity. Scenes of body horror bear higher emotional stakes than your average horror film. It's a film of few kindnesses and many graces.	2014-04-22
An uncompromising look at slavery in the Antebellum South. Anchored by career-defining performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o, director Steve McQueen brings his assured directorial mind to a harrowing, but necessary picture.	2014-03-15
There are no false pretenses or unnecessary charging, instead, there is patience and time. The moments of suspension often become the biggest delight.	2014-03-13
Much of it is difficult to watch, but '12 Years a Slave' is that rare film that's both important in its message and a darned good film all the same.	2014-03-08
While the praise for 12 Years a Slave has been rather overblown, it's still a recommendable film due to its incredible cast, which helps cover up its weaknesses.	2014-03-06
This is a truly impressive piece of filmmaking.	2014-02-27
O que nos torna racistas nao e o preconceito que exercemos de maneira ativa, mas a intolerancia contra as mais diversas minorias que simplesmente nos mostramos incapazes de perceber.	2014-02-21
It's a heavy, depressing film but it's also one that's hard to discredit.	2014-02-14
McQueen has used this near-documentary style of filming before, but this is the first time it's seemed essential to his story.	2014-02-13
An unflinching, uncomfortable and entirely necessary modern classic.	2014-02-12
There is a reason that Slave has topped the best of list of 25 major film critics and won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. Miss it at your own loss.	2014-02-11
The direction from Steve McQueen is visceral, the script from John Ridley doesn't waste a word, and the performances are, without exception, brilliant.	2014-02-07
Using dialogue sparsely and shocking images relentlessly, McQueen's movie brilliantly explores the implications and legacy of slavery, and debunks some of its more cherished myths.	2014-02-06
Minds will be opened, perhaps even changed by what they see (and indeed, feel) here.	2014-02-06
Fortunately, 12 Years a Slave is not just a minor vanity project for Brad Pitt, who is one of its producers, but also a courageous step forward for director Steve McQueen.	2014-02-04
The film imparts the casual cruelty of slavery with full force without having to resort to graphic portrayals of on-screen brutality. The film certainly has those, but they are sporadic, well-judged and serve the larger story of a man starved of freedom.	2014-02-02
12 Years A Slave tackles America's primal sin of slavery with unflinching honesty, leaving in the shade Hollywood's previous efforts to address the subject, from Gone With the Wind's rose-tinted myopia to Django Unchained's gore-and-irony-soaked fantasy.	2014-02-01
Generally more concerned with making its audience wince than with forging an indelible imprint on the soul.	2014-01-31
It may well be the greatest film ever made about slavery, but that says more about the movie world than the work itself.	2014-01-30
In its portrayal of violence and spectatorship, it stays in the mind.	2014-01-29
McQueen shoots long takes in which the action (as in the emotional action, or intention) is the focus, involving us deeply and meaningfully in the characters, their circumstances and the broader context. The impact is strong.	2014-01-25
Involving and disturbing with an inspiring central performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, this is a ballsy film with themes every bit as confronting as those broached by McQueen in his earlier films Hunger (2008) and Shame (2011)	2014-01-25
12 Years A Slave boasts a number of quietly powerful moments, but it doesn't offer much to think about. Though Ejiofor delivers a remarkable lead performance, the film proves emotionally distant.	2014-01-15
The fortuitously named [Steve McQueen] follows up his previous pictures Hunger and Shame with this similarly pit-of-the-stomach venturing, queasy-making drama	2014-01-13
Ejiofor proves himself a master of physical understatement, the clench of his teeth and slightest parting of the lips speaking volumes.	2014-01-12
This is a terrifically well-intended and necessarily difficult movie to watch: but I'm not entirely convinced McQueen has delivered quite the masterpiece some would suggest it is.	2014-01-10
A tale of suffering, endurance, courage and abiding humanity about a freeborn man kidnapped and sold into slavery, which packs all the more wallop for the elegance with which it's made.	2014-01-10
Ejiofor projects extraordinary integrity, even nobility - and he holds the camera magnificently. It's a deeply inward, deeply felt performance, surely a cert for one of the many Oscars this film must win.	2014-01-10
The American South's "peculiar institution" has, it seems, become a fit topic for narrative cinema. And it only took a century.	2014-01-10
This is history alert to the many gradations that inform any fully formed understanding of the past; history unbound.	2014-01-10
12 Years a Slave proves McQueen's formal prowess and, more significantly, his utter seriousness as a dramatist.	2014-01-10
Much more than a film about 19th century slavery in America, this sharply well-told true story has a lot to say about the world we live in today.	2014-01-10
There's little doubt that this painfully authentic adaptation of former slave Solomon Northup's memoir is an important film. But it is not an easy one to sit through.	2014-01-10
I have seen it twice now, and on both occasions it has managed to enthral and appal in just about equal measure.	2014-01-09
It does what great cinema should do: takes you on an extraordinary journey and make you feel grateful to be alive.	2014-01-09
12 Years a Slave isn't simply a masterpiece, it's a milestone. This, at last, really is history written with lightning.	2014-01-09
Twelve Years a Slave is a magnificent achievement and it is a career best for everyone involved, not least its artist-turned-director, Steve McQueen.	2014-01-09
The whole film breathes with reality, even while the bayou landscapes are infernalised, surrealised, by a terrible beauty of vision.	2014-01-09
A flat-out masterpiece, a magnificent, uncompromising and emotionally devastating slavery drama with a superb script, stunning direction and an extraordinary central performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor.	2014-01-09
One of Britain's greatest living filmmakers offers an outraged, intense and artful examination of American slavery.	2014-01-09
A relentless, raw and visceral condemnation of a viciously racist regime that condemned its victims to a life of hard labour with random cruelties thrown in and justified by a skewed interpretation of the Old Testament.	2014-01-09
McQueen's previous films were called Hunger and Shame; there is plenty of both in this almost unwatchably shocking and violent film.	2014-01-09
The cumulative emotional effect is devastating: the final scenes are as angry, as memorable, as overwhelming as anything modern cinema has to offer.	2014-01-07
Visceral, vital and anchored by its earnest performances, this is a potent portrait of a shameful historical truth.	2014-01-06
The violence is starkly pictured by McQueen, lingering on black skin torn apart to reveal milky white flesh and, of course, red blood.	2014-01-06
Falling between the twin pillars of the art house and prestige period flick, 12 Years A Slave is history lesson as horror film, powerful, visceral and affecting.	2014-01-05
Solomon's story doesn't need fictionalising to be absolutely devastating, and McQueen tells it straight, trusting its account, and his actors, to make it resonant.	2014-01-04
In a film brimming with great performances -- including Fassbender as the ruthless Epps, and Nyong'o's star-making work as the tormented Patsey -- Ejiofor's portrayal of Northup shines.	2013-12-31
12 Years a Slave remains an important film, if nothing else for the fact that these are not anonymous characters created for Hollywood storytelling, but one man's remarkable story that puts a face on history.	2013-12-31
Their persistent aggravation with each other indicates so much time spent together, so much intimacy and so little self-knowledge. (They misunderstand each other so well.)	2014-04-08
This is a universal X-ray of bourgeois love, one that in a few decades will get around to something like Amour.	2014-01-06
This film explores the complexities and complications of modern love and life in an international setting with dialog that is smart and elegant, but it lacks the romance and sense of place featured in the first two films.	2014-01-01
The movie's funny at times and difficult at others, and ends absolutely perfectly. The best of the three.	2013-11-27
Delpy and Hawke talk and talk and talk but it is all fascinating.	2013-11-25
An excellent statement (and warning) about the dangers of being in love with love.	2013-11-10
Hawke and Delpy emerge multi-dimensional and riddled with flaws. In a long-term relationship, you may think you know what the other is thinking, but do you ever really know?	2013-11-02
Like the other two, this is a film that breathes. It just holds on a little more before it's willing to exhale.	2013-11-01
Like the Up series, a return to visit old friends	2013-11-01
Making a movie with nothing more than smart dialogue and fine performances is a dying art, but Linklater, Hawke and Delpy remind us that it's a skill worth saving.	2013-10-23
Before Midnight feels like the natural extension of the series, and will be everything fans of it could have hoped for.	2013-10-05
The trouble with those first two film was their souffle-light scenarios...Here, however, things are much juicier as infidelity, commitment, divorce, resentment and all the other soul-sapping things that clock in when you hit your 40s come into play.	2013-08-20
...in the surprising third act, the film comes together as a plausible horror show of how good intentions and real affection can give way to vicious, realistic psychic combat. (	2013-08-16
...Before Midnight bears too few similarities to its thoroughly superior predecessors.	2013-08-10
The reason this film will hold your attention for two hours is because of the natural dialogue between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.	2013-07-20
Before Midnight is like an old friend who has grown sharper and grumpier and saltier with life; and for students of cinema, the film is a masterclass in the use of the language and tools of this amazing artform to portray human nature	2013-07-19
The beauty of this film - like the two before - is its natural flow of conversation and ability to engage and transport us into the moment	2013-07-19
The release of each sequel is becoming an event, so it's particularly great to see Before Midnight not only meeting expectations but raising the bar.	2013-07-16
It's a brave, challenging and essential installment in what is one of modern cinema's finest trilogies.	2013-07-15
The beauty of this film - like the two before - is its natural flow of conversation and ability to engage and transport us into the moment	2013-07-13
Before Midnight is no romance. It's a horror movie.	2013-07-05
Takes its traditional romantic tale into more insightful territories.	2013-07-04
Hawk and Delpy know just how to get under your skin. Their onscreen alter egos fit like a glove, and witnessing their ageing, nagging, toying love is a true privilege.	2013-07-04
What lifts Linklater's trilogy above your average dialogue-heavy indie is not just the intelligence of the conversation but its frankness and humor.	2013-07-03
There's not a hint of melodrama or falsity in the Before series.	2013-06-29
The 'Before' trilogy is a vacation for me. I am taken away, and it is never for long enough. I genuinely feel lucky to have these movies.	2013-06-29
I'm not sure this is the end of Richard Linklater's 'Before' trilogy. It's perfection just as it is, but then again, Linklater has nine more years to work on the sequel.	2013-06-28
Loving words mix with personal attacks, the magic moments with the unintended slights, as we witness the occasional desperation of imperfect people doing the best they can when life moves beyond meet-cute and courtship. That's authentic.	2013-06-25
Linklater and his players bring an end to the fantasy and welcome the thrilling ups and bitter downs of reality to this love story.	2013-06-24
Like the first two films, it reflects the real world in a way that seems almost preternatural. It's just that, here, the real world is a harsher, more disappointing place.	2013-06-23
The duo, clearly so comfortable in their characters' skin, indulge in intelligent banter, sharp humour and emotional truths.	2013-06-22
So much better written than contemporary novels, this film is a literary as well as cinematic achievement to cherish. For grown-ups.	2013-06-22
As before, it's often very funny, with Jesse and Celine swapping Woody Allen-esque one-liners - nicely snarky, appealingly abrasive.	2013-06-22
The acting, the dialogue and direction are superb.	2013-06-22
None of the films is faultless in itself, but, tinted with complementary tones, the complete cycle comes as close to perfection as any trilogy in cinema history.	2013-06-21
Marvelous. It's impossible to shake the feeling that we are merely eavesdropping on reality. Witty, wise, and -- most important of all -- truly romantic in ways that movies usually aren't.	2013-06-21
It's been 18 years since Hawke, Delpy and Linklater introduced us to Jesse and Celine, and their story just gets richer, funnier and more punchy each time we see them. In 1995's Before Sunrise, they were idealistic 23-year-olds.	2013-06-21
Hawke and Delpy are as believably real as any screen couple can ever be.	2013-06-21
This is one of the few sequels for which the cliche 'eagerly awaited' is truly applicable.	2013-06-20
Predictably, it's just as great as the first two.	2013-06-20
By the end, Before Midnight inches towards a dawn of charm. But it's a troubled trip.	2013-06-20
As an organic experiment in collaboration between actors and director, it is a triumph, co-created and co-owned by Delpy, Linklater and Hawke.	2013-06-20
Hawke and Delpy, who are both credited on the script too, have never found co-stars to bounce off more nimbly or bring out richer nuances in their acting.	2013-06-20
The performances and dialogue are wonderfully naturalistic; a reminder that the best special effects are often the cheapest.	2013-06-20
Before Midnight is about the nature of long-term relationships, and the way love deepens and grows but also finds itself subject to the complications of maturity. Smart, insightful, and poignant.	2013-06-19
For those who witnessed Jesse and Celine's tentative getting together as inter railing students almost twenty years ago, it's reassuring to see them still in love.	2013-06-19
Brilliantly directed, superbly written and impeccably acted, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, thought-provoking and emotionally engaging drama that perfectly complements the previous two films.	2013-06-19
It remains as engaging, illuminating, honest and funny as its predecessor; here's hoping we revisit Jesse and Celine in another decade or so.	2013-06-19
Hawke and Delpy remain as charming as ever, and their combined goofiness is more endearing than annoying.	2013-06-18
Nine-year gaps between films would sink a studio franchise, but the unforgiving impact of time and the slipperiness of its mysterious mental record, memory, are the very subjects of 'Before Midnight.'	2013-06-18
Brie Larson is superb in this brilliant exploration of life in a short term care facility where troubled teens try to find a way to survive in the care of compassionate men and women.	2014-03-15
A heartbreaking drama about the lingering affects of childhood abuse and neglect, even under the best of curative circumstances.	2014-03-10
Short is all nuanced performances bathed in sumptuous Californian sunlight: its realism is reflected in its lo-fi aesthetic and naturalistic cinematography.	2014-03-07
Short Term 12 is cinema at its most compassionate, vulnerable, and human.	2014-02-20
Cretton is able to leap tall towers of everyday humour and humanity and then suddenly drop you into a pit of total, gut-wrenching sadness in a single bound.	2014-02-07
Short Term 12 hits hard at times, yet despite its potentially melodramatic subject matter, never once feels manipulative or overwrought.	2014-02-07
Short Term 12 is the kind of cinematic rollercoaster that will make your heart swell one moment and leave you in tears the next. It's simply unmissable.	2014-02-07
It's hilarious, it's sad, it's anger-inducing, it's warm.	2014-02-06
A gripping and often compelling character study and a wonderful human drama.	2014-01-23
Short Term 12 offers the most concrete proof yet that Brie Larson will be with us long-term.	2014-01-15
a monumental work of compassion	2014-01-12
There's an 'American' quality to its social conscience that I cannot recall perceiving in any other recent film.	2014-01-09
An unexpectedly moving character study about welfare and painful upbringings.	2014-01-08
A powerful and passionate film that presents its flawed characters in an honest and heartbreaking fashion that will be hard to forget.	2013-12-23
Sufferers of 'Stendhal syndrome' - that singularly wonderful and hopelessly human disorder in which people confronted with particularly beautiful artworks become dizzy and often faint - beware.	2013-12-16
It's often heartbreaking, but ultimately the film takes us to a truthful yet positive conclusion	2013-12-14
While the topics are serious and the film heartfelt as it provides a genuine insight into troubled lives, there is a surprising lightness about much of the experience, making the bitter-sweet journey all the more rewarding	2013-12-14
Brie Larson is very impressive as the caring, funny supervisor whose own demons threaten to engulf her.	2013-12-10
The performances, too, are uniformly splendid, especially from Brie Larson as Grace and John Gallagher as Mason.	2013-12-10
If we're lucky -- if the tides are right and the winds are calm -- we might get one or two movies a year as good as Short Term 12.	2013-12-10
Short Term 12 will having you laughing one minute and tearing up in the next.	2013-12-10
There are so many pitfalls, and it seems like every TV movie version of the story falls into all of them at the same time. But in Short Term 12, writer-director Destin Cretton manages to skillfully step over all of them.	2013-12-10
Sacramento native Brie Larson gives one of the best performances of the year in Short Term 12, an affecting drama from writer-director Dustin Cretton.	2013-12-10
Set in a foster-care facility outside of San Francisco, this independent drama is vivid and heartfelt in its depiction of social work, at times recalling some of Frederick Wiseman's great documentary portraits.	2013-12-10
...an engaging, emotional little drama that bodes well for Cretton's future endeavors.	2013-12-09
There's a hilariously scatological tale told at the beginning, a sweetly uplifting one at the end, and in the middle a parable about a lonely octopus that may be the most heartbreaking thing you'll hear all year.	2013-11-26
Crettin's script delivers warm, humorous dialogue and his direction a wealth of naturalistic performances, chief among them Larson's understated, incandescent turn as Grace.	2013-11-15
The film's climax feels a little rushed and overwrought, but the movie's real resonance is its exploration of empathy and vocation.	2013-11-15
Cretton is not afraid to be uncool; he embraces the strong emotions that scare some indie filmmakers and that scar -- in some cases literally -- his young characters. The result is a movie that is passionate, compassionate and has the ring of truth.	2013-11-15
At times Short Term 12 seems uncertain where it's going, but this matches the circumstances of both staff and residents.	2013-11-14
A wonderfully authentic film about the families built from the fragments of broken homes	2013-11-07
Brie Larson (21 Jump Street) is outstanding in the leading, tripled-edged role of Grace.	2013-11-07
The acting is very good in this film and the screenplay is powerful. It is evident this is a low budget movie, but it works very well despite its production limitations. This is one of the best films I've seen this year.	2013-11-07
Documentary-style authenticity gives this understated drama a real kick as it explores the fallout of child abuse from an angle we'd never expect.	2013-11-06
incidents seem more idealized than authentic	2013-11-06
Despite the heavy subject matter, the film never bogs down into the daily grief it depicts, but maintains a jaunty current of humor that counterbalances its melodramatic content.	2013-11-04
The kids are sensitively drawn, if a little pick-and-mix in terms of their issues and ethnicities, and the whole movie breathes with kindness and intelligence.	2013-11-04
Short Term 12 thrives on the dangerous chemistry between its young, talented actors.	2013-11-01
As a stepping stone for both Larson and Cretton, it leaves you tantalised as to what they'll do next.	2013-11-01
Short Term 12 wants to shine a light on these under-paid, under-valued figures and cheats, just a little, to get the job done.	2013-11-01
Somewhat slighter than the festival raves would have you expect, Destin Cretton's indie flick is nonetheless a wholly affecting, gently nuanced drama - and a portfolio piece for rising star Brie Larson.	2013-11-01
Well intentioned, but somehow inauthentic.	2013-11-01
Larson is one to watch.	2013-10-31
A barnstorming performance from Brie Larson is the reason to see this bittersweet drama of damaged teens.	2013-10-31
The film succeeds by its simple storytelling technique - no explosions, no sweeping music signaling emotional peaks, no big reveals. It's just unsuperhumans...hoping to scratch out some joy and ward off the shadow of loneliness.	2013-10-31
There are perceptive scenes and abrasive moments. But there's also a soapy need to launder every problem into a happy or "closured" denouement.	2013-10-31
This is a walk through familiar territory, but it wins you over step by step.	2013-10-31
There are no star names here but there are star turns, most notably from Brie Larson...	2013-10-30
The lead character's called Grace, but don't be put off: Cretton's tough-love snapshot of shattered youth is achingly moving rather than manipulative or mawkish.	2013-10-29
There's heart, soul and personality to burn in 'Short Term 12' ... But this is a film that, like many of its young characters, desperately needs to calm down.	2013-10-29
McConaughey masterpiece as a a man on the run in Mississippi.	2014-02-09
If Mud isn't the best movie of this young year, it's certainly the most instantly satisfying.	2014-01-01
Despite an almost sluggish pace, Nichols nevertheless finds the rhythm of Southern rural village life with its wary think-hard-before-you-speak watchfulness.	2014-01-01
Nichols truly takes you into this world and while the story may be a bit unsettling, the performances refuse to allow you to take your eyes off the screen.	2014-01-01
Mud might feel old fashioned and familiar but it is also a delicate and atmospheric film rarely made by Hollywood these days.	2014-01-01
Glorious vision of youth and truth, love and loss, your name is Mud.	2014-01-01
An evocative highlight of the American movie year so far.	2014-01-01
Sadly, Nichols, who made the superb Take Shelter, gets mired in mood this time around. But there's still an evocative sense of childhood exploration, and a gritty performance by Matthew McConaughey.	2014-01-01
Nichols gives the story a languorous pace, but the beautiful scenery and naturalistic characters make this a film best enjoyed slowly.	2014-01-01
Mud earns its Mark Twain comparisons with its rich understanding of love through an early teenager's eyes.	2013-11-21
A realistic, gripping and expressive boys' coming-of-age adventure story.	2013-11-21
Often the movies absorb these ideas in plots that are eager to retread to action and violence, but Nichols finds a resonating and sharp tone here that understates those desires.	2013-09-05
A highly personal tale of undergrown men and overgrown boys experiencing the growing pains of love turned unrequited, and the realization that nothing-not freedom, not security, not innocence, not love-lasts forever. [Blu-ray]	2013-08-13
Mud improves steadily as it progresses, however, as Nichols does a superb job of fleshing out the story and characters...	2013-08-10
Mud should cement [writer-director Jeff Nichols'] reputation as a storyteller capable of extracting intense excitement from character-based dramas.	2013-08-06
Warm, humorous, and smart, a Huckleberry Finnish snapshot of carefree boyhood on the brink of adolescence.	2013-07-12
Mud is about the fragility of men, the craving to be loved - by a woman, by other men - and how easily that love is misplaced, taken away, cheated or lost.	2013-07-01
Mud has a rare big-screen beauty, and its old-fashioned storytelling recalls A River Runs Through It, Night of the Hunter, and Stand By Me.	2013-06-28
This moody, broody character-driven crime story is another fine step in the career redemption of Matthew McConaughey.	2013-06-28
Mud is the kind of small scale, character driven drama one rarely sees out of the States any more, and cements Nichols as one of his country's most significant independent auteurs.	2013-06-26
Just like its lead character, this film is packed to the brim with sadness, swagger and soul.	2013-06-23
All the women in this movie are shrews, liars and/or emasculators.	2013-06-23
Mud is a moving exploration into the nature of manhood, with superb performances, striking location and engrossing story creating a mesmerising and heartfelt coming of age drama.	2013-06-20
A stripped back approach to tracking the process of growing up, but lacks the faith to see the plan executed to the end	2013-06-18
Nichols takes his time unravelling Mud and Ellis's entwined fates, but his characters are so rich that it's well worth being in their company.	2013-06-16
In its energy and nuance, Mud seems like the kind of film Hollywood would've made in the Seventies, and would've continued to do if not for the advent of market-conscious filmmaking.	2013-06-14
More than a mere tribute to Twain and Dickens: this has all the makings of a modern classic.	2013-06-13
An extremely sophisticated and progressive examination on how adolescent masculinity is defined by often-contradictory cultural attitudes towards femininity.	2013-06-12
For at least three-quarters of the way, this is a fine film, and one that kids and parents could see together.	2013-06-12
Mud is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to, and feel kinship to, whether you're from the South or just Southern at heart.	2013-06-10
In Jeff Nichols, America has a champion of the religious and working class. With the schism between the right and left in the U.S. growing ever larger... his ascent couldn't have come at a better time.	2013-06-09
This is a film with a great naturalistic style and captivating performances and which does just about everything right.	2013-06-07
Jeff Nichols writes characters with depth, nurtures strong performances form his cast and allows the screenplay's backwater setting to effectively create tone and texture.	2013-05-31
This is American cinema at its very best as Huckleberry Finn meets Stand By Me.The two boys are terrific and McConaughey is sensational as Mud, dazzlingly frazzled as the hunted and haunted man on the run.	2013-05-24
Up till just past the three-quarter mark, Mud is one heck of a nifty psychological fable.	2013-05-23
The Southern-fried drama "Mud" is an electrifying example of what happens when you merge a crackerjack yarn with a very specific setting, and then pour on the heat with riveting performances.	2013-05-23
McConaughey and Sheridan 's acting skills, as well as those of the entire supporting cast, make this movie better than it ought to be.	2013-05-22
It gets under our skin because Nichols gives us time to come to know Mud's island like the places we knew as children.	2013-05-22
As Mud might say, it's a hell of a thing.	2013-05-17
The boys are so skillfully played that Mud also plays like cinema verite. Nichols' fluid camerawork suggests a documentary-style approach. That helps these young lads transform into flesh-and-blood characters who get our attention and support.	2013-05-17
There is an enchanted-fairy-tale aspect to Mud, but its bright, calm surface only barely disguises a strong, churning undercurrent.	2013-05-17
Sheridan, who played the Terrence Malick surrogate in The Tree Of Life, is terrific at conveying adolescent confusion with tiny squints and frowns, and McConaughey plays off him masterfully.	2013-05-16
Carefully crafting films that fly just below the political radar, director-writer Jeff Nichols is slowly, but surely, reweaving the fabric of the American dream.	2013-05-16
A modern fairy tale, steeped in the sleepy Mississippi lore of Twain and similar American writers, and with a heart as big as the river is wide.	2013-05-16
It's totally worth it to pay good money to see a good, little film nestled between theaters showing 'Iron Man 3' and 'The Great Gatsby.' (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)	2013-05-16
This is a junior adventure story echoing Huckleberry Finn and Stand By Me, a tale which is in no hurry to unfold, but beautifully done, exquisitely performed, and filled with terror and wonder.	2013-05-16
Beautifully acted, intellectually engaging, and dramatically satisfying, Mud deserves to rocket to the top of your must-see list.	2013-05-15
'Mud' is a standout film in this 'coming of age' genre mainly because of its central character, one tough, warm-hearted, stubborn little kid who believes in the power of love, above all else.	2013-05-14
Other than pacing problems that needlessly stretch the film past the two-hour mark, 'Mud' slings the dirt and sweat with the best of them, as it both mourns and celebrates a way of life that's all but disappeared.	2013-05-13
A sublime coming-of-age film, 'Mud' would be the offspring if 'Stand By Me' and 'Cape Fear' reproduced.	2013-05-13
An underlying sadness gives the film some weight balanced by moments of farce. For Coen fans, it's can't-miss.	2014-04-23
Near-comedy, near-tragedy, "Inside Llewyn Davis" is close to great, and in its extremely concrete yet endlessly elusive form, close to perfection.	2014-04-07
A beautiful, unassuming, rewarding ache of a movie.	2014-02-20
This film's re-creation of 1961 New York feels totally convincing in its shabby, run-down glory and the sense of having a real window back into the past isn't something to be underestimated.	2014-02-13
Llewyn's tragedy is the Coens' stroke of genius.	2014-02-06
It's not their best-in fact, it hardly even feels like a Coen brothers movie at all-but its majestic musical numbers and fantastic performances elevate this well above the humdrum lesser filmmakers churn out.	2014-02-06
Where O Brother's picaresque was all sepia, bluegrass, hayseed slapstick and family reunion, this film offers a stringent voyage of overcast skies, melancholy folk, soured relationships and no direction home.	2014-02-06
Musically and visually, Inside Llewyn Davis offers plenty of frictionless pleasures to compensate for the prickly scrappiness of its hero.	2014-02-05
The Coens can be so good when they just get over themselves.	2014-02-04
A fascinating look at depression, artistry and the struggle of everyone to find a place.	2014-02-03
Deftly observed, touchingly melancholy and slyly funny.	2014-02-01
The Coen's offbeat sensibility and predilection for leftfield characters is a perfect fit for the world they've chosen to explore.	2014-01-31
The music choices alone will ensure this haunting, beautifully detailed film will live a long and lasting life.	2014-01-31
Certainly you miss much on first viewing, but so far even a second sitting hasn't quite changed my admiration (great as it is) to affection.	2014-01-26
Hilarious in the Coens' weird, askew way, but also absolutely crushing. This movie breaks my heart in a hundred different ways.	2014-01-24
It's typically Coen; wit and pathos in equal measure, glazed with colourful characters and pitch-perfect performances, with a soundtrack that perfectly captures the setting.	2014-01-24
This blackly comic character study set in the hotbed of New York's early-60s folk scene fails because there's zero character development.	2014-01-24
All this might get tiresome in the hands of anyone but the Coen brothers, who based the story on the memoirs of the singer-songwriter Dave Van Ronk.	2014-01-24
It is confident and self-congratulatory in its ability to evoke unease or melancholia or claustrophobia in a single cut or composition or camera angle.	2014-01-23
Inside Llewyn Davis is a Coen brothers charmer about&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201; almost absolutely nothing you could pin down as a substantive subject. That is its charm ...	2014-01-23
A bold and tantalising performance by Isaac who defies the actor's instinct to let us inside...	2014-01-23
Isaac, a talented musician in his own right, inhabits the role so fully and believably you expect Davis to pop out of the screen cap in hand for a few pennies after a song.	2014-01-23
Cold exteriors and warm interiors combine in the Coen brothers' rhapsodic portrait of a '60s folk singer.	2014-01-23

I was somewhat bewildered on leaving the cinema but Inside Llewyn Davis is a film that has stuck with me.	2014-01-21
Like Llewyn, the film drifts a bit, moving episodically from song to song. Fortunately, these musical setpieces are often the highlights of the film.	2014-01-20
Beautiful, heartfelt and utterly enthralling.	2014-01-20
Beguiling, beautiful, funny and sad, the film is like a luminous time travel ride, taking us deep into the hipster heart of New York's Greenwich Village, circa 1961, in the middle of the flowering folk music scene.	2014-01-18
The film has a frustrating, neither-here-nor-there quality.	2014-01-17
Inside Llewyn Davis is a movie you chew over days after seeing it.	2014-01-17
The film's towering achievement is that it cuts through the haze of nostalgia while celebrating what made a certain place at a certain time special.	2014-01-16
A masterly Coen screenplay - up there with A Serious Man and The Man Who Wasn't There for its portrayal of male neuroses and failure.	2014-01-16
A character study of a guy who sabotages himself at every turn, along with one of the best soundtracks this year, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is another superb Coen Brothers film.	2014-01-14
I felt affection. I felt sympathy. I felt finally the Coen brothers had a hero they loved, and I in turn have grown to love him too.	2014-01-14
Definitive for any artist whose drive to persevere demands a wanton disregard for practical sense	2014-01-14
Incisive, irresistible and often very funny, Inside Llewyn Davis also proves itself to be a poignant and quietly profound meditation on what it means to be an artist.	2014-01-13
A flawless piece of classic Coen brothers cinema, exquisitely timed and told by all. Quite possibly their finest work yet.	2014-01-12
The unreliable, brooding Llewyn is a prickly sort, making it a challenge for his industry - and movie audiences - to fully embrace him. And yet, the talent is undeniable.	2014-01-11
The best film of 2013. ... As with many works from great filmmakers, how much you invest in the movie may determine how much you derive from it.	2014-01-11
The Coen brothers have composed something special with their anti-hero story of a young muso on whom fate has slammed the door. The surprising thing is that despite this apparently bleak theme, the Coens craft something unique, warm and big hearte	2014-01-10
The wonderful thing about a Coen Brothers film is the fact that you are never sure exactly what you are going to get. One thing is for sure, you will always get more than you've bargained for	2014-01-10
Flawed, multi-dimensional characters are a Coen brothers specialty. You'll like none of them but will love the movie and the music.	2014-01-10
Every scene in Inside Llewyn Davis is a sumptuous delicacy of dialogue, performance, setting and scintillating subtext.	2014-01-10
...a meditation on authenticity, the mystery of creation and the mischief that is made in the lands between art and commerce	2014-01-10
It steers away from any kind of sentimentality, so any time serious discussion of success or failure - either commercially or artistically - come up, they are torpedoed like some kind of sick joke. That itself carries a special kind of poignancy.	2014-01-10
Inside Llewyn Davis hits a few sour notes, but overall it's a successful emotional composition told in very simplistic terms.	2014-01-09
Like many of the Coens' films, this one has a dark whimsy to it, peculiar and funny but run through with deep melancholy.	2014-01-09
Oscar Isaac plays the title character... and his performance bleeds with strained empathy and mysterious reserve.	2014-01-09
"Davis" may be the saddest comedy you ever see, or the funniest drama. In other words, this is a Coen Brothers movie, odd and endearing, and one of their best.	2014-01-09
An often heartbreaking look at the way that even the most talented artists can end up with nothing but thwarted dreams.	2014-01-09
Smart, thoughtful docu shines light on background singers.	2014-05-05

This is a musical field of dreams high in corn, but also, sometimes, in the epiphanic empowerment and wonder of stardom conferred.	2014-03-27
A warm and fitting tribute to talented singers.	2014-03-27
A highly entertaining musical history lesson that could (and should) just boost a few careers into the bargain.	2014-03-24

This must-see documentary for any fan of modern pop music introduces us to the extraordinary women you didn't know were behind some of the songs you know by heart.	2014-02-27
The message is that singing is a higher calling than chart success - a point this history makes with intelligence, grace and killer music.	2014-02-24
This is the type of film that should be shown to any teenager aspiring to endeavor a career in the arts.	2014-02-06
Morgan Neville's soulfully doting documentary pays tribute to the background singers who've been so essential, albeit anonymously, to rock 'n' roll history.	2013-12-31
20 Feet From Stardom doesn't shy away from the harder truths of the industry, but it goes down easily, and is stylishly assembled, spryly executed, and satisfyingly arced to end in triumph.	2013-12-31
Though it never quite digs as deep as it thinks it's going, 20 Feet from Stardom is a richly entertaining experience, mostly because the music does so much of the work.	2013-12-31
By turns funny, rousing, intriguing, sad and frustrating.	2013-12-31
It's that versatility that defines these singers, the ability to make following seem as important as leading.	2013-12-31
The documentary tells similarly poignant stories in a fast-paced 91 minutes through interviews, contemporary concert footage and great archival stuff.	2013-12-31
The backup singers profiled in 20 Feet From Stardom have been crucial to the soundtracks of our lives, but their stories have rarely been told before.	2013-12-31
The unforgettable film highlights the stories of gifted vocalists who pray their time is going to come, which transcends the music industry. Isn't that what most of us hope for? In many ways, we all start in the background.	2013-12-30
If I had this much talent in the one room, and so much concert footage of them bringing down the house, adding 'la la las' and 'oohs' to some of the greatest songs ever written, I wouldn't quite know what to cut out either.	2013-12-08
While major names turn up for interviews (a gracious Bruce Springsteen, a funny Mick Jagger, a technical Sting), this is primarily all about these unsung singers, especially the great Darlene Love, who began her career under contract to Phil Spector.	2013-11-25
An affecting love letter to those who spent their lives on the edge of the spotlight.	2013-11-21
A hit on the festival circuit, affectionately told, Twenty Feet from Stardom is a treat.	2013-11-17
A life affirming, toe-tapping documentary that not only places the magnifying glass on back-up singers, their role and music, but examines the music scene and its icons during the past 50 years	2013-11-14
As long as you're hearing the singing and stories of Lisa Fischer, Merry Clayton, and the great Darlene Love, you can bliss out on their passion.	2013-10-04
Part musical history lesson, part performance film and part character study -- all of which combines to become its own song of hope and inspiration.	2013-09-20
Backup singers step into the light in a great music documentary.	2013-08-30
All of these special ladies -- most of them ironically unsung and often exploited -- obviously know their way around a microphone	2013-08-17
A heartfelt and rousing documentary tribute to the talent and artistry of female backup singers.	2013-08-01
I guess it leaves us with the message not everyone is destined to be a star, for one reason or another.	2013-07-28
Although a few white and male backup singers appear, the film becomes a de facto chronicle of the experiences of many African-American women in show business, who -- like their counterparts in less high-profile jobs -- often are undervalued and exploited.	2013-07-22
In a way, critics are the backup singers of film.	2013-07-22
20 Feet From Stardom will be highly entertaining to anyone who ever let a needle drop into a '70s-era groove.	2013-07-19
Neville does a good job of highlighting songs that are especially characterized by backup singers, like Lou Reed's 'Walk on the Wild Side,' and introducing us to some of the 'unsung' talent that made those hits possible.	2013-07-18
This fantastic glimpse into the lives of background singers, old and new, directed by Morgan Neville, is completely mesmerizing.	2013-07-13

This is a fascinating doc for pop, soul, R&B and rock fans, for it peels back the often unfair layers of the music business like the skins on an onion. Sometimes, it'll make you cry to witness how terribly these talents were treated.	2013-07-11
The movie takes its cues from Standing in the Shadows of Motown, another act of pop-culture revisionism that tried to give musical credit where it was due.	2013-07-11
It's important to finally put names and faces to the voices of these women because, without them, countless songs would sound horrible.	2013-07-11
It's a warm, earnest and lively movie, anchored by a superb lead performance.	2014-04-21
The movie revels in activity and vitality, promising that of course it's possible for one to keep having fun no matter what age they are. At the same time, it's under no illusions about the trepidation that comes with the twilight years.	2014-04-08
Brilliantly brought to life by actress Paulina Garcia, Gloria is not afraid to put herself out there at a Santiago dance club for over-50s, where she drinks, boogies and is on the lookout for Mr. Right.	2014-04-03
Garcia's appealing performance makes us root for her.	2014-03-25
The movie insists on the value of the everyday. Gloria's heroism is her dignity, her intelligence, her perseverance.	2014-03-24
The film is far from what we usually see.	2014-03-19
Looking for love... after 50	2014-03-07
A raw and rich look at loneliness, love and aging.	2014-03-06
For each person who sees Gloria as someone else's mother or co-worker, she's quietly determined to be the centre of her own imperfect world.	2014-03-05
An engaging character study that taps into feelings that are very difficult to put into words	2014-03-02
Subtle, quiet, delicate and unpretentious, Gloria is among the most satisfying films I have seen in years.	2014-02-28
Garcia's performance is wonderful. The more we watch her, the more beautiful her character becomes.	2014-02-28
What could in less capable hands so easily have been mishandled, lapsing either into patronising comedy or sappy sentimentality, is accorded generous and sympathetic treatment here.	2014-02-28
Chilean director Sebastian Lelio's Gloria is a warm, intimate, sharply funny depiction of a life in progress.	2014-02-28
If the film itself doesn't win viewers over with its refreshingly rounded story, Garcia's offering of a vulnerable and tenacious heroine will; make no mistake, audiences will be singing Gloria's name.	2014-02-28
Look, how often do we see films about people of this age finding love and particularly finding sex and so this is quite original from that point of view?	2014-02-27
This is what getting old is all about. GLORIA is nicely acted, nicely shot, it's just a teeny bit dull.	2014-02-27
To look into Garcia's face is to see the movie, a loving character study, in miniature at any moment: Gloria refuses to be your stereotype or a writer's stock character. She's complicated, like you...	2014-02-27
See it now, and see it before the inevitable insufferable American remake.	2014-02-26
The humour comes mostly from painful places, our recognition of painful truths and/or just the authenticity of responses by the characters, sometimes delivered as nothing more than a glance or a thin smile.	2014-02-21
A knock-out performance from Paulina Garcia as Gloria anchors this insightful portrait of a life-loving woman searching for fulfilment	2014-02-21
Seeing Gloria makes you realize it's possible to portray middle-aged romance, and sex, without resorting to goofy caricature.	2014-02-20
The overall effect is to slowly create a wonderfully three-dimensional character, lovingly shaded and detailed.	2014-02-20
Sebastian Lelio's melodrama about a woman's determined search for love and meaning is hilarious and disquieting, sometimes within the same moment.	2014-02-17
A sometimes fascinating, sometimes obtuse character study.	2014-02-15
A feel-good movie that you don't have to feel bad for liking.	2014-02-14
We are with Gloria throughout the film, in every scene, as if we are her guardian angels.	2014-02-14
Garcia wears every wrinkle like a war medal, allowing us to sink into her matronly bosom with a warm embrace, and infusing us with enough strength to keep laughing.	2014-02-13
Chilean actress Paulina Garcia's performance in "Gloria" is simply flabbergasting.	2014-02-13
Not quite a comedy and not quite a drama, this Chilean film looks at middle age from a refreshingly even-handed perspective, not a wacky or tragic one.	2014-02-13
A casual atmosphere that sneaks up on the viewer, and the reward for such patience is the opportunity to spy a seasoned character realized onscreen with refreshing honesty.	2014-02-13
There might be times where you wish for a little more narrative momentum, but basking in the glow of this grounded but vibrant woman never really gets old.	2014-02-10

Paulina Garcia gives a powerhouse performance in a completely naturalistic setting.	2014-02-07
Although this Chilean film's narrative ambitions are modest, Gloria is a likable movie that's anchored by an outstanding performance by Paulina Garcia.	2014-02-07
"Gloria" is that rare work, a truly adult film. By its end, you want to cheer the simple act of living.	2014-02-07
By the end, we dance with her, living in the moment as she does, not looking ahead to life's next turn.	2014-02-06
This is a driven, indelible character -- like the women Gena Rowlands played for John Cassavetes -- and you fear her going over the edge not least because you suspect you'd follow her.	2014-02-06
Most films past the mid-life point either don't acknowledge romance and sexuality, or make it the central point of the story; the frank, comfortable, yet warmly erotic way Gloria deals with it is a breath of fresh air.	2014-02-06
Writer-director Sebastian Lelio, whose fourth feature this is, has a confident way of parceling out exuberance and melancholy in a setting of mundane everyday realism.	2014-02-06
The best compliment the Chilean drama deserves is that it captures how it feels to be its title character.	2014-02-06
Audiences intuitively search for someone to root for in a film, and Garcia's Gloria, who's in practically every frame of the movie, fits that bill perfectly.	2014-02-05
Lelio's non-restrictively comedic scenario, scripted by him and Gonzalo Maza, makes a great space for Garcia's wholesale refusal of self-pity.	2014-02-04
She has the ego and the thick, bobbed hair and big glasses reminiscent of Tootsie. But the vivacious middle-aged woman at the heart of Chile's Oscar submission, 'Gloria,' leaves no doubt she's all female.	2014-02-02
"Gloria" explores better than any movie I've seen how, when middle-aged divorcees become a couple, they are still affected by their relationship with their ex-spouses and children.	2014-01-31
Director Sebastian Lelio paints&#65279; a subtle picture of a self-assured, independent woman who is sometimes sad but is more often happy, ready to take on life's adventures.	2014-01-31
A smart, incisive portrait of a woman who lives life on her own terms and doesn't let herself get pushed around.	2014-01-31
The movie lets you make up your own mind about this vivacious woman, who is doing her best not to surrender to her inner loneliness.	2014-01-31
Gloria, spare and keenly observed, plays like a short story - there is no sweeping narrative arc, no momentous triumph or calamity.	2014-01-31
Hitchcock once said that other directors made slices of life; he made pieces of cake. Lelio's feat is that he's made a slice of life that's a piece of cake, too.	2014-01-30
There are important films and there are good films, and the two do not necessarily always overlap. Wadjda is both important and very, very good.	2014-04-08
Filmmaker Haifaa Al Mansour uses the simple story as our entry into a complex culture and a pointed perspective on how women are treated in Saudi society ...	2014-04-03
This is a film to be admired for both its on-screen and off-screen story.	2014-03-28
A warm, winning, restless film...Beautiful, modestly progressive and heartfelt, with a wonderful, brash central performance from first-timer Waad Mohammed.	2014-03-21
The overall pro-freedom message comes through loud and clear. Rhetorically speaking, the trick of using childish innocence to reveal adult hypocrisy is virtually foolproof.	2014-03-21
It's a provocative but credible premise and in exploring it, Al Mansour has come up with an engagingly subversive character. Wadjda is a delight.	2014-03-21
The film disguises its liberal editorial message with a superbly veiled screenplay; we're just looking ... but of course, we're also seeing, a much more invasive activity	2014-03-16
This charming and deceptively simple film about a rebellious young Saudi girl with a dream that defies the culture in which she lives, is a breath of fresh air; the insight into lifestyle and culture fascinating	2014-03-16
By any standards, this [is] a fine, moving film and essential viewing for anyone who cares about contemporary cinema.	2014-03-14
Her film is like she is, ostensibly playing by the rules, but throwing us enough sidewise glances to let us know that she's much smarter than she appears.	2014-02-28
It has a neat, sly way of folding complex pissed-off politics into crowd-pleasing narrative simplicity.	2014-02-04
A kindred spirit to "Offside" and "Persepolis", this film is ten times more inspiring than "Breakaway", another tale of an underdog and a bicycle. A must-see.	2013-12-22
A series of close and long shots follow as Wadjda rides and wobbles, as she grins broadly and gains momentum in this tiny space, as she shares her glee with Abdullah. Even without using their voices, they express so much.	2013-12-17
Rather than making a grand political statement, the film excels in its quieter and more intimate moments.	2013-12-11
The movie ends on a highly emotional note that might easily have tipped over into bathos. But Al-Mansour knows her stuff -- she earns her emotion honestly.	2013-12-10
Simple but charming.	2013-12-10
Al Mansour's first feature film is a striking achievement.	2013-12-10
Wadjda generally feels anchored in the authentic-feeling life of one authentic-feeling girl.	2013-12-10
Films like Wadjda do not come around very often.	2013-12-10
In the title role Mohammed makes a sweet scamp, wry and watchful, always chancing her arm even as she senses trouble ahead -- which is, in a nutshell, what most Saudi women can expect of life.	2013-12-10
Haifaa al Mansour's debut merits recognition for its fresh-feeling take on the trope whereby the travails of a child protagonist mirror those of a wider society.	2013-12-10
The real victory is the mere fact that it exists, because like Wadjda riding a bike, Al Mansour directing a film is considered entirely non-traditional.	2013-12-10
On the most basic level, Wadjda is a wonderful piece of filmmaking. It's a tale that's delightful and insightful and gently transgressive, and Al-Mansour tells it with economy, lyricism and terrific warmth.	2013-12-10
The most radical and cheering message of Wadjda is that a change isn't just possible, but inevitable.	2013-12-10
Free from ranting or raving, this quiet celebration of joy of the spirit is one first step towards righting centuries of repressive wrong.	2013-12-05
... a glimpse inside a relatively affluent society (Wadjda and her mother live comfortably, despite enduring financial hardship) where most people abide in the interstitial territories between secular Western decadence and Islamic fundamentalism.	2013-12-05
'You forget that women's voices shouldn't be heard by men outside,' a teacher says near the start of the film, in an early indicator that the movie is going to champion the cause of giving women back their voices, so to speak.	2013-11-15
What gives the film such sparkle is how deeply it immerses us in the life of a remarkable little girl.	2013-11-08
... details a culture's repression of women starting at a young age: denial of simple enjoyments, remaining silent and subservient around men, the constant pressure to conceal femininity; a situation covered in movies that can't be covered enough.	2013-10-31
The spunky Wadjda offers a familiar story in an unfamiliar setting.	2013-10-31
On the surface, it's about a plucky 10-year-old girl who wants a bicycle and uses ingenuity and hard work to raise money to buy one. Yet it's really about the crushing future that awaits Wadjda when she grows to womanhood.	2013-10-25
(T)he first film shot entirely inside Saudi Arabia ... is an insightful and sometimes delightful story of a young girl chafing under but refusing to bend to the social restraints she is only beginning to discover.	2013-10-25
Unveils rarely seen glimpses of Saudi culture	2013-10-22
Writer/director Haifaa al-Mansour's story is relatively simple, although the world it reveals is deeply complex.	2013-10-18
"Wadjda" earns extra points just for being what it is. Who knew that, in a country that famously frowns on women driving cars, some are even allowed to make movies?	2013-10-17
A populist exercise in the neo-realist tradition of "The Bicycle Thief" and "The White Balloon."	2013-10-17
This delightful debut feature by a Saudi woman named Haifaa Al-Mansour uses a bicycle as a metaphor for freedom within a social circumference.	2013-10-17
A movie that's almost miraculous in the way it subverts our images and expectations of Saudi life.	2013-10-15
A sweet little film about the human spirit, about want and energy and determination against unfair odds.	2013-10-11
The result is fascinating -- not a flat-out lashing against Saudi Arabia's patriarchy, yet definitely not an endorsement of it, either.	2013-10-10
Beautiful, nuanced tale of an independent Saudi girl.	2013-10-08
In Saudi filmmaker Haifaa al-Mansour's winsome wonder Wadjda, a young girl's aspirations provide an intimate glimpse into the possibilities and limitations of a cloaked culture.	2013-10-04
Though the influence of Italian neorealism is clear in Wadjda's unshowy style and generosity of spirit, this film remains a singular achievement for all the best reasons.	2013-10-04
Both uplifting and realistic, charming and incisive.	2013-10-03
More than a critique of Saudi society, "Wadjda" offers a character with universal resonance and appeal.	2013-10-03
Al-Mansour seems out to make a movie that works in America. Which is likely a savvy move, since it seems unlikely she's going to get much traction back home.	2013-10-03
The film is deserving of its position as a pioneer. It's a heartfelt, touching peek into the day-to-day life of a culture Westerners rarely get to see.	2013-10-03
Wadjda is a movie about freedom - and nothing represents freedom with the metaphoric simplicity and symmetry of a bicycle.	2013-10-03
"Wadjda" is a terrific film.	2013-10-03
Wadjda captures Saudi life on the cusp of serious change, but it's by no means a solemn drama. Al-Mansour writes and directs with a light touch and hopeful aspect.	2013-10-03
Phoenix's performance is imbued with such genuine heartsickness that Theodore's musings on why his marriage fell apart ring of piercing, real-life regret, not break-up bromides.	2014-05-22
'Her' reduces love to a purely intellectual pursuit. The body is oddly irrelevant, the soul absent, reproduction abandoned. The result is dehumanizing. And yet fascinating.	2014-05-16
An abundantly earnest look at the pain of loss and the rebirth of new love that somehow feels wholly original and familiar at the same time.	2014-04-21
It's an incredible technological tale about love, human connection, and a question of a higher power.	2014-04-21
The only other filmmaker who knows how to make sound, music and moment fit like a fitting of a perfectly suited slipper would be Sofia Coppola. Patience. Trust.	2014-04-04
If Her is indeed a male fetish fantasy (as one journalist claimed), it's an odd one, presumably aimed at the same men who get a thrill from having their member sheathed in sandpaper.	2014-03-01
As Her slips into an inevitable melancholy, it becomes less about trans-humanity and more about, well, humanity.	2014-02-28
A beautiful, bewitching and deceptively warm experience.	2014-02-27
For the first time with Her, the relationships Jonze brings to the big screen blossom into something bigger than the story and setting around them.	2014-02-27
Witty, tender and arrestingly gorgeous, Her is a masterpiece. Phoenix's central performance is of the lofty levels we have come to expect of him while Johansson disarms with only her voice.	2014-02-21
In a calculatedly ambiguous way, Jonze appears to be both simultaneously mocking and embracing a genre (a tactic he used previously in Adaptation).	2014-02-20
Audacious gimmicky sci-fi romance story between a lonely divorced writer with his newly purchased OS1.	2014-02-19
A film you can revisit time and time again.	2014-02-17
In the battle between head and heart there remains a Tin Man-shaped hole, leaving the viewer smiling wryly at the thought-provoking conceits while remaining as emotionally isolated as the movie's protagonist.	2014-02-16
It is a sweet-natured and melancholy film, beautifully directed, that manages to be satirical about love in a digital, distracted age without losing its heartfelt quality.	2014-02-14
The combination of Jonze's dialogue, the intensity of the performances and the way the film's style wraps you up in Theodore and Samantha's inner-ear relationship makes this feel like a uniquely apt diagnosis of contemporary ills.	2014-02-14
At two hours, Her is a little too long, but it ably demonstrates Jonze's talent for mature and magical film-making.	2014-02-14
Her is a brilliantly reimagined rom-com, only obliquely interested in its sci-fi setting, which is casually disclosed as the film goes on, never foregrounded.	2014-02-14
Sweet, smart, insightful, funny and thought-provoking ...	2014-02-14
Its insights into relationships are sharp without being earth-shattering. But as a window onto a relationship that carries real meaning for the two people in it, Jonze has created something crystal-clear.	2014-02-13
The film seems very new, but the sentimental ending is as old as the hills. There are some great moments.	2014-02-13
We need more subplots. (Even just one.) Instead we get a life sentence of staring at Phoenix's face while the actor, as skilfully as he can, goes through the 12 steps of disenchantment in his one-man LA therapy classes.	2014-02-13
Whimsical futuro-romance effortlessly evolves into ambiguous, unfathomable hard sci-fi in Spike Jonze's best film to date.	2014-02-13
This unlikely menage-a-trois has created an offbeat romance of remarkable warmth and credibility.	2014-02-13
There are some memorable moments ... and Phoenix is very watchable.	2014-02-13
With only a hint of a futuristic setting, Spike Jonze takes a remarkably honest look at human emotions as a man and his computer's intelligent operating system fall madly in love with each other.	2014-02-13
Set in the not-too-distant future, this is a poignant, moving love story for the Apple age.	2014-02-13
A concept like Her can be expressed satirically or sincerely but it can't easily be both. Jonze, who also wrote the screenplay, plumps wisely for the second option. It's the right move.	2014-02-12
Spike Jonze's Oscar-nominated drama is a beautifully written, superbly acted and emotionally engaging drama that explores the nature of love and relationships in an increasingly digital world.	2014-02-12
Like Marco Ferreri's I Love You (1986) or Craig Gillespie's Lars And The Real Girl (2007) played out amidst the technological singularity, Jonze's strange SF-lite romance brims with love actual and intelligence artificial. Log on now.	2014-02-12
A keeper of a film, quietly dazzling	2014-02-11
A beautifully shot provocation that is more interesting as a conversation on the way home than as an experience in the cinema.	2014-02-10
Jonze has made a sweet, smart, silly, serious film for our times, only set in the future.	2014-02-10
Seriously, I think this is the first time I can remember seeing Phoenix smile on camera since "Parenthood."	2014-02-09
Nossos sentimentos, enfim, sao reais ou apenas expressoes quimicas de nossos pensamentos e dores? Nao, mais importante do que isso: faz alguma diferenca?	2014-02-08
Her asks us to consider what constitutes a 'real' relationship in a world where every interaction is filtered through technology, making it feel like a vital contemporary romance.	2014-02-06
[Jonze's] latest, the futuristic sci-fi romance, Her, is another film of unrivaled excellence, one that taps into ideas and themes in the way only the mind of Mr. Jonze can. It is hands down the best American movie of 2013.	2014-02-06
[A] tender, wry, deceptively modest package -- and the closer you look, the more it reveals itself to be the proverbial Movie For Our Times.	2014-02-06
With Phoenix's face and Johansson's voice, Jonze has solved the screens-are-boring problem.	2014-02-05
Her left me as empty as an unplugged monitor.	2014-02-04
Beneath Jonze's rueful whimsy and bittersweet soft-focus love story lurks the prospect of a dystopian sci-fi thriller	2014-02-04
The romantic intimacy is remarkable considering the two main characters never kiss, or share an embrace, or even look at one another.	2014-01-31
As touching as it is funny, as profound as it is absurd, Her is a true 21st century love story.	2014-01-24
With funny work from Chris Pratt as Theodore's boss and fine performances from Amy Adams as his mousey friend and Phoenix himself, this had the capacity to become darker but Jonze isn't interested in being nasty.	2014-01-23
Spike Jonze is, despite proof consisting only of four features, one of the best filmmakers working today. His latest, Her handily verifies it.	2014-01-23
An old-fashioned romantic convention run through an innovative wavelength of sci-fi wi-fi that doesn't seem all that out of sync with today.	2014-01-23
With Jonze playing down his trademark absurdist humour and opting for a melancholy tone, we are left with a rather sad cautionary tale about the future of human intimacy.	2014-01-22
As expected for such an acclaimed film, it is extremely well-written and well acted. It is a wonderful love story. But computer sex? I couldn't quite buy it. Trust me fellas, the computer is faking it.	2014-01-22
...anyone who has found themselves intoxicated by another soul should find much to love in Her.	2014-01-22
The amount of pleasure you take from Her is likely to correlate with your willingness to suspend your sense of disbelief.	2014-01-21
The movie's greatest strength [is] Russell's magnanimity toward his characters, an equable, never cloying embrace of their imperfections.	2014-05-22
David O. Russell has a gift for the farce at work in American institutions, and in American Hustle he's created another instant classic.	2014-05-05
David O Russell's film fizzes with energy and wit, bowling along with a brio that matches the quick-wit and razzle-dazzle of its con artists.	2014-05-04
David O. Russell's '70s caper nearly out-Scorseses Scorsese. Rollicking fun stuffed into '70s wrapping paper.	2014-04-23
Amy Adams is spectacular, febrile, dramatic, comic, sharp, sarcastic and magnificent to look upon, especially her soaring laughter in an explosive comic-sexual scene set in a nightclub ladies' room stall.	2014-04-07
To call the end result an absolute triumph would undercut more apropos labels; it seeks to be one of the best films of the year, and transcends that goal.	2014-03-05
Pode ate ser uma especie de Os Bons Companheiros versao light, mas nao deixa de ser incrivelmente divertido.	2014-02-07
Like the Abscam con, the film is a convincing confection, so well played that we don't care if it's the real deal or not.	2014-02-06
Look, I think this is a fabulous film.	2014-02-06
One of the films of the year for me.	2014-02-06
A fun, energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters, but mostly fails to succeed..	2014-02-03
Definitely an actor's film, with some great moments and terrific performances within an uneven story backed by a killer 70's soundtrack.	2014-01-31
Wide characters, deep storytelling, bad hair and a great 1970s soundtrack fill this stylishly seductive comedy about small time con artists working their way up the food chain.	2014-01-22
What could have been a trifling little caper movie becomes, in the hands of Russell and his superb cast, a rich, character-driven film of humor, drama and surprising warmth.	2014-01-16
David O. Russell's American Hustle is slick, surprisingly funny, and actually makes the horrendous styles of the 1970s look kind of appealing.	2014-01-14
Russell's world view is essentially optimistic and romantic	2014-01-12
Spearheaded by enormously charismatic actors and a script's verbal wit that overrides its untidiness.	2014-01-08
Save your admiration for the performances, especially Lawrence, who is now Hollywood's most important presence in front of the camera.	2014-01-08
It turns out that comb-overs, cleavage, cocaine and kookiness are an unbeatable combo.	2014-01-08
'American Hustle' is smart, sophisticated and slick. Director David O. Russell has been nominated for the Academy Award for both last year's 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'The Fighter,' and he's bound to earn at least a nod again this year.	2014-01-07
One of the ten best films of 2013.	2014-01-07
It's like a pastiche of a '70's Sidney Lumet picture: well made, well performed but lacking the bite and shrewd intelligence of the older movies it reminds you of. In this way it's a better movie about modern American filmmaking than the era it recreates.	2014-01-07
Another memorable masterpiece cleverly crafted by the oh so talented David O!	2014-01-07
To understand the breadth of disco-era deception laid out in American Hustle, understand that the most honest character in the movie is a politician. Not entirely honorable but compared with the swindle sharks circling, he's Jimmy Carter on Sundays.	2014-01-06
Grand Performances move "Hustle"	2014-01-06
Fun, charming, but slight - and way too long and flabby in the girth for such slightness.	2014-01-06
A tour-de-force piece of filmmaking about the art of survival - and a cinematically-glorious throwback to the Gene Hackman era.	2014-01-05
Are we being played? Oh, yeah. Just because the time and place of a film takes place within personal experience doesn't mean it's not a historical epic.	2014-01-03
This is one you'll want to hustle to see on the big screen.	2014-01-03
American Hustle doesn't conform to one genre, though it has elements of farce, screwball, heist thriller and caper comedy. In dressing it up like a Scorsese-style crime movie, Russell brings an unusual weight and tension to [the film].	2014-01-03
Russell, writer Eric Singer, and the hyperventilating cast keep us guessing well into the second half.	2014-01-03
Casting Christian Bale as a Bronx Jew makes as much sense as casting Woody Allen as a Baptist minister from Alabama, not that casting Woody Allen in Bale's role would have saved this mess of a film.	2014-01-03
Though never boring, American Hustle does itself feel a little like a con - a skilled exercise in creative misdirection.	2014-01-03
Russell opts for chaos over clarity and love over work	2014-01-02
One of the few 2013 movies I was sorry to see end	2014-01-02
more successful than any of the cons on-screen is the con Hustle plays on its audience,	2014-01-02
Is there a better actress currently working in movies today than Amy Adams?	2014-01-02
The actors act up a storm and the tacky period detail, from hideous sofas to men in curlers, fills the screen, but in the end it all feels too staged, too played, too self-aware to fully work.	2014-01-01
That American Hustle is set in the '70s is the perfect coincidence, for it is a movie that would have fit right into the "New Hollywood" of that era where directors were king, actors went beyond the pale and stories had balls.	2014-01-01
A complicated FBI sting operation is combined with not one, but two love triangles in this sharp, witty comedy drama topped by an audacious ending. The writing crackles with authentic-sounding dialog and the acting is superb.	2014-01-01
The script by Eric Singer and David O. Russell is rife with banalities and ludicrous situations, mostly involving the mafia.	2013-12-31
"American Hustle" is marginally entertaining, and ultimately not a satisfying movie-going experience.	2013-12-31
Believe it or not, amidst all of the oversized collars and outlandish suits, [Russell] wrings pathos out of [his characters].	2013-12-30
American Hustle ultimately establishes itself as yet another disappointment from David O. Russell...	2013-12-28
An incongruous jumble, American Hustle's supporting cast and Lawrence's stellar turn lingers in the eye, not the movie as a whole. For a film that perhaps attempted to break a mold, it suffers from simply not knowing what it wanted to be.	2013-12-27
ABSCAM comes alive in this stereotype drenched, pratfall ridden but entertaining story of good people lost in the American promise.	2013-12-26
If David O. Russell's earlier movies sometimes felt like an attempt to create layered, Kid A-style concept albums, American Hustle feels more like him onstage at the Silverdome, banging out the loudest open chord he can and hip thrusting at the audience.	2013-12-25
For a good time, come see this adorable, sexy, deviously antic piece of cockeyed comedy. You want nominations?	2013-12-25
American Hustle isn't a bad film... but it's certainly an overrated one.	2013-12-25
A story that spins out of control and lacks a comedic focus.	2013-12-24
For all it's artistic shortcomings, though, I really hope that this movie is able to instigate some kind of change in the way we treat orcas, or at least how we think about them.	2014-04-08
Powerful, heartbreaking, disturbing doc about captive orcas.	2014-01-21
Perhaps the documentary form does have the potential to effect sweeping social change. Only time will tell.	2014-01-05
Blackfish delivers ominous chills not because it documents orca whale attacks, but because it makes a clear, strong case that the attacks are of humankind's making. It's more Frankenstein than Jaws.	2014-01-01
Plainly, it's an advocacy film. And it's a brilliant one -- nail-biting, upsetting, maddening and at times even uplifting,	2014-01-01
Save the whale? After watching this documentary about the mistreatment of killer whales, you'll never mock that sentiment again.	2014-01-01
If you're not moved and angered by what you see in Blackfish, your heart is made of harder stuff than mine.	2014-01-01
Gabriela Cowperthwaite's new documentary Blackfish is a searing indictment of the entire killer whale-as-entertainment industry.	2014-01-01
A troubling expose of Sea World's hazardous entertainment trade.	2014-01-01
Blackfish is a heartbreaking documentary, forensically constructed by Gabriella Cowperthwaite, about the extreme psychological distress of killer whales kept in captivity and used to entertain crowds at venues such as SeaWorld in Orlando.	2014-01-01
Blackfish makes an especially strong case for the innate marvel of these animals: that they are smart, social, communicative and loving.	2014-01-01
'Blackfish' proves in our pseudo-reality, entertainment-hungry world that the art of documenting is not lost. Docs can still create change - and for SeaWorld, the perception of the theme park is forever changed.	2013-12-30
Expoe nossa cegueira para o fato de que o que julgavamos um show era basicamente uma cruel, imperdoavel e longa tortura.	2013-12-30
An absolutely heartbreaking documentary...	2013-12-09
For animal lovers with fond recollections of visiting SeaWorld as a child, director Gabriela Cowperthwaite's Blackfish arrives to gatecrash your memories.	2013-11-26
Very good, very disturbing documentary by director Gabriela Cowperthwaite about killer whales in captivity and the dangers they present to their trainers...The film contains some pretty vivid footage.	2013-11-21
[This is] heart-in-your-throat stuff. I feel bad calling actual footage of a man almost dying as being 'thrilling,' and yet that's what it is. We need a new word for Blackfish's innately cinematic and all-too-real horror.	2013-11-21
The telling is calm and composed, avoiding any form of sensationalism or heightened anger. It probably won't win the Oscar for Best Documentary, as The Cove did on ... dolphin slaughter, but Blackfish is solid, revealing and quietly moving.	2013-11-20
If you see this, you won't want to ever visit one of these water parks with killer whales again, or work at there either.	2013-11-19
Taken in sum, Blackfish is a punishing indictment of a multi-million dollar industry and one of the finest documentaries of the year.	2013-11-17
A blistering critique of the exploitation of performing orcas in marine parks.	2013-11-12
While Cowperthwaite's documentary doesn't exactly come up with much of anything new to say on the matter, it remains an intriguing look at the problem.	2013-11-11
Gabriela Cowperthwaite's eye-opening, edge-of-your-seat feature "Blackfish" has it all: an oversized villain, chilling attack footage, corporate malfeasance, and girls in bikinis.	2013-10-31
You don't have to be an animal-rights activist to appreciate its questioning of the justifications for keeping highly intelligent mammals... in tanks to perform for our entertainment	2013-10-24
In the wild, orcas live between 50 and a hundred years. In captivity, it's half that. It's simply a strong argument to free all the Willies.	2013-10-23
It builds a compelling case to show the negative results of capturing and confining such noble creatures as the blackfish.	2013-09-15
Blackfish takes an emotional argument and supports it with just enough logic to make it convincing.	2013-09-05
Although emotionally wrenching and not recommend for young children, 'Blackfish' helps us re-think our relationship with nature.	2013-08-30
It's a riveting tale that will make you rethink where humans and orcas fall in the natural food chain and the corporate one.	2013-08-26
likely to never again buy a ticket to a marine theme park again	2013-08-26
We have traditionally taken license to do as we will with our fellow creatures, whether that means slaughtering them for food or dressing them up for Halloween. Perhaps only a God created in our image could sanction ... the ways we exploit the vulnerable.	2013-08-26
In many ways, "Blackfish" is a horror film in which we discover that we have met the monster, and the monster is us.	2013-08-23
Blackfish is what happens when human arrogance trumps harsh natural reality.	2013-08-16
It doesn't go very far out of its way to tell more than one side of the story, but the one side of the story that it does tell is an exceedingly compelling and moving one.	2013-08-16
The movie recounts - often with horrifying video - several instances in which trainers are mauled, chomped and otherwise clobbered by killer whales.	2013-08-15
Blackfish is a zoological horror story, a corporate expose and a heartbreaking example of inhumane practices and predictable consequences ignored.	2013-08-15
There are few movies that can change the way you see the world in 83 minutes. If Blackfish is seen by enough people, it has the power to affect attendance at SeaWorld.	2013-08-13
You don't have to be anything close to a PETA loyalist or an anthropomorphist to appreciate the genuine sorrow and eventual psychosis on display in footage of these whales.	2013-08-08
"Blackfish" is a disturbing movie, one that will make you rethink parks like SeaWorld and their value.	2013-08-08
Whatever its flaws, 'Blackfish' seems likely to be the rare film that inspires real reform and that helps awaken viewers to their kinship and responsibility to the animal kingdom.	2013-08-08
The question that "Blackfish" provokes, viscerally, is whether the education and entertainment for visitors, and profits for the company, are worth it if the animals are mistreated and unhappy. After watching "Blackfish," the answer is crystal clear.	2013-08-08
Depressingly unsurprising.	2013-08-02
While Blackfish isn't exactly riveting, it is thought-provoking and leaves you with the urge to admire nature in its natural habitat rather than in a contained environment.	2013-08-02
Blackfish is intended to rattle and provoke in the hopes of bringing about change.	2013-08-02
A repetitive but still compelling piece of activist filmmaking.	2013-08-02
"Blackfish" is grim. But then again, so is the plight of these magnificent, intelligent whales.	2013-08-02
Informative, earnest, but less than briskly paced.	2013-08-01
An engrossing look at animal behavior.	2013-08-01
"Blackfish" makes a compelling case that the cruelty of life in captivity is the cause for a rash of fatal attacks by orcas on their trainers, aggressive behavior that no so-called killer whale ever has exhibited in the wild.	2013-08-01
Its ultimate message is clear: Killer whales belong with their families in their natural habitat, not performing for audiences. After listening to this film's many impassioned voices, it's hard to argue.	2013-08-01
A slate of great performances cap off a compelling look at the way we build up and destroy the very relationships we want to engage in.	2014-04-27
How it all plays out, even without the unexpected layer of wistful Gandolfini remembrance, is sad and funny at the same time.	2014-02-04
Dreyfus and Gandolfini generate chemistry aplenty!	2014-01-26
How the two deal with this situation is the crux of the story and the reactions are quite real and believable.	2014-01-03
As a romantic comedy for grown-ups, Enough Said is something of a refreshing rarity. Both Gandolfini and JLD are wonderful, as is Nicole Holofcener's naturalistic dialogue. Enough Said.	2013-12-31
A wonderful, original film, and it's never a distraction for one second that the two participants are played by people as iconic as Tony Soprano and Elaine Benes.	2013-12-26
Great acting and smart dialogue are a killer combination. This touching, wise and spiky romance really crawls under your skin.	2013-12-11
The film contains Gandolfini's final lead role, but his performance is cherishably un-final: easy, open and insisting on nothing, it's the work of a man who is just getting started.	2013-12-11
Helping anchor affairs, though, is the bear-like Gandolfini, who brings charm and gravitas to a movie that might otherwise have seemed very superficial.	2013-12-11
As wonderful as Gandolfini is here, Louis-Dreyfus is a revelation as the motherly yet self-denying Eva.	2013-12-11
These are the subjects that Holofcener does exceptionally well -- the myopia, vanity and insecurities of the moderately privileged.	2013-12-11
The strong point of the film is the writing by Nicole Holofcener ("Friends With Money"), who also directs this film. The dialog is smart and witty, with loads of funny one-liners and funny situations.	2013-12-08
raises some serious issues of relationships	2013-12-08
Slow-burning adult drama full of chuckles derived from well-written characters and top-notch acting...	2013-11-28
...a perceptively funny romantic comedy about the responsibility that comes with loving another.	2013-11-26
No matter how he looks in the film, Gandolfini's Albert is so unbelievably sweet and sincere and nice that it's impossible not to be charmed by him, and to wonder what might have been.	2013-11-25
James Gandolfini will be missed. He could play a brute, as in 'Killing Them Softly,' or, as he does here in 'Enough Said,' a lovable, albeit flawed, regular guy. Either way, you cared about the characters into whom the late Gandolfini breathed life.	2013-11-25
A rom-com that's actually, miraculously both romantic and comedic.	2013-11-18
Enough Said is [director Nicole Holofcener's] best, most abrasive, yet touching film thus far. It's a knowing deep-dive into impulses that are stupid, fragile, selfish and deluded as two people try forming post-relationship relationships.	2013-11-14
It's been about fifteen years since Julia Louis-Dreyfus last graced the big screen; an absence I hadn't even realised. That's on me. Having now witnessed her comeback effort, Enough Said, it's an absence I pray we never have to endure again.	2013-11-10
It may well have been titled Too Much Said, as two divorced women and a bickering married one are thrown into a relationship train wreck - two of them participants, the third a snappy onlooker	2013-11-09
The delicacy of nuance and the impact of the minutiae are placed under the microscope in this keenly observed comedy about relationships and the unpredictable essence of human behaviour. This is filmmaker Nicole Holofcener's forte	2013-11-09
Happiness and companionship is precious as your journey is closer to its end than the beginning. Holofcener's Enough Said is old enough to dismiss bullsh*t like dwelling on the past.	2013-11-09
...an engaging, affable piece of work...	2013-11-06
There are some big laughs, and the relationship dynamics generally feel authentic.	2013-11-02
'Enough Said' says plenty...beautifully and effortlessly.	2013-11-01
The poignant relationship story is a gem.	2013-10-27
Enough Said is an adult comedy to savour, a wonderfully sharp and humorous exploration of the muddy path of growing older and looking for love. Gandolfini is great as the reluctant romantic lead, effortlessly sliding from calamity into comedy.	2013-10-25
Dreyfus and Gandolfini show there is romance and problems with romance at every age	2013-10-24
Just the type of movie fans have come to expect from writer-director Nicole Holofcener, who emerges every few years from the economic security of episodic television to deliver another wry, acutely observed, character-based comedy-drama.	2013-10-23
A typically astute and funny reading of the foibles of human relationships, spiced up with a forgivably contrived comedic plot twist.	2013-10-21
With a cheeky grin never far from Albert's [James Gandolfini] lips, fellow stars might well find this almost unbearably hard to watch just four months after his death.	2013-10-18
Aside from the script's lightness of touch, it's the characters' small quirks and tics that bring the film to such vibrant life.	2013-10-18
With a strikingly against-type performance from the late Gandolfini, this film gives the romantic-comedy formula a welcome adult spin.	2013-10-18
A superb middle-age rom-com about the need to accept change and the wisdom to resist it.	2013-10-17
It is a slight romantic comedy given heft by the excellence of the two leads, and smartly scripted by writer-director Nicole Holofcener.	2013-10-17
A delightful, warm-hearted and frequently funny comedy with an emotionally engaging, sharply observed script and a pair of wonderful performances from Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini.	2013-10-17
Some films are a cold shower, others a warm bath. Enough Said is mainly a warm bath but bracing morality gives the romantic comedy an anchor in common relationship reality.	2013-10-17
Too depressing.	2013-10-17
Enough Said is a lovely coda to an actor whose career was cut short to soon.&#8233;	2013-10-17
As Etta James might say: at last. A romantic comedy that is romantic and funny and not simply an insult to the intelligence of all carbon-based life forms.	2013-10-17
The joyous thrust of this thoroughly entertaining - and often poignant - comedy thrives on the sparkling chemistry between Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus, a romance pitched at that often overlooked demographic - the middle-aged divorcee.	2013-10-16
Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini are especially wonderful.	2013-10-15
Enough Said is Nicole Holofcener's best yet - it's what we wanted from the new Bridget Jones book, a smart comedy about dating in your 50s.	2013-10-15
A charming, big-hearted movie and a fitting valediction to a much-mourned actor.	2013-10-14
Enough Said is a match made in romantic comedy heaven - heart-warming and frequently hilarious.	2013-10-14
Assured, adult filmmaking from a writer/director who knows her way around the ups and downs of relationships. It's also a fitting tribute to the talent of the gentle, grizzly Gandolfini.	2013-10-14
One of Holofcener's strengths is her ability to portray female friendships with all their underlying politics, as well as delivering some great salty banter.	2013-10-12
A believable and organic funny-sad-dramatic tonal medley.	2013-10-04
Though the general anxiety level doesn't run quite as high in Enough Said as it did in Holofcener's brilliant 2010 effort, Please Give, there's still a fine balance of the same acerbic humour and messy emotional vulnerability.	2013-10-04
As in many films of this genre, fiction or fact, finesse gives way to firepower force, and though the real-life outcome is fixed in advance, the voyage is exhilarating.	2014-05-01
About an hour in, though, much hell breaks loose. Greengrass' avid, excitable camera moves begin to match the action, to become the action.	2014-04-22
The script, adapted from the book written by the actual protagonist, is not romanticized or glossed over with overreaching sentiment, and Greengrass' direction matches it with a style that is consistently tenacious.	2014-02-21
After a gripping start in which Phillips tries to outrun the pirates, the excitement lessens once they clamber aboard.	2014-02-07
Storytelling in its purest form: it works as a no-fat thriller, yet it achieves nuanced character dimension and thematic complexity	2014-02-06
[W]e're carried along not just by the momentum of events, but by the precision with which they're depicted.	2014-02-06
While the events depicted here do at times suggest a sort of Die Hard on the high seas, the tone is refreshingly anti-triumphalist.	2014-02-04
The final scenes alone, make "Captain Phillips" worthy of being called a masterpiece.	2014-01-31
While I find it a little strange that it's been getting as much awards attention as it has, it's still worth taking a look at for Greengrass' intense direction and a story that will have your eyes glued to the screen. For most of it at least.	2014-01-20
One of the ten best films of 2013.	2014-01-07
It's a sweaty-palmed, relentless thriller - and a damned good one.	2013-12-30
Not only a riveting drama about quiet heroism, but an eye-opening look at a clash of cultures.	2013-12-22
Captain Phillips is indeed a gripping, grueling, agonizing, nail-biting, brutalizing, kick-punching motion picture, but beyond the technical thrills and vise-grip tension, it also offers a weary, hard-won empathy.	2013-12-22
Tom Hanks gives a fine, un-showy and sublimely focused performance.	2013-12-21
It goes from exciting to exhausting mighty quickly and the final act.	2013-12-21
The disappointing aspect to Captain Phillips is that it doesn't go beyond action movie conventions.	2013-12-21
Captain Phillips repeatedly underlines the Navy's brilliance, and also the contest between Rich and Muse, their exchanged looks in a tight, hot space suggesting they might share a burden. But they can't.	2013-12-17
Over and over in this movie we hear variations on the phrase "everything's going to be OK." It's just impossible to head out of the theater and back into the wider world believing that's actually true.	2013-12-10
We're in the steady hands of Paul Greengrass, a director fully aware that convincing crisis stories involve conflicting interests and passions.	2013-12-09
What Hanks does is give Phillips a thoroughly human portrayal, convincing us how an ordinary man does extraordinary things in the face of death.	2013-12-09
It spends as much time on true-to-life protocols as thrills and spills. And it's a film in which Tom Hanks sweats unattractively from his man-boobs. Talk about uncompromising	2013-11-20
Familiar territory for Paul Greengrass, Captain Phillips is far more successful in terms of authenticity and tension that it is characterisation or depth.	2013-11-19
In a way it seems like a parody of a [Paul] Greengrass film: His cameras shake and the music swells but the narrative is stuck in neutral for a good hour-plus. It's all herky-jerked up with nowhere to go.	2013-11-14
...a fascinating true-life tale...	2013-11-13
The number one thing I took away from Captain Phillips (and Zero Dark Thirty before it) is: Don't. Ever. Mess. With. America. They take that (stuff) personally.	2013-11-12
While "Captain Phillips," to its credit, honors the pirates with more back-story, and they evolve as characters ...the end still lands squarely in a Hollywood space.	2013-11-12
Captain Phillips is a prime example of Hollywood's unrivalled ability to rapidly reprocess a story from headline to marquee. And it's a splendidly mounted, nerve-racking thrill ride, building to an almost unbearably tense climax.	2013-11-08
I can't see too many people being disappointed with the complete package that is Captain Phillips.	2013-11-03
Awards-worthy work by director Paul Greengrass and leading man Tom Hanks.	2013-10-31
The experience is more nuanced than you might expect.	2013-10-31
A dramatic thriller that's also a 'message movie' concerned with the effects of globalisation, this offers fine work from Hanks in serious mode, although the whole thing is stolen from him on a grand scale by Abdi.	2013-10-30
Taut, terrific filmmaking.	2013-10-30
Captain Phillips' aesthetic is vintage Greengrass: cinema of the moment with a festering voyeurism so insular it barely seems to exist beyond the boundaries of the frame	2013-10-29
A remarkable and harrowing story about modern-day piracy and understated heroism on the high seas.	2013-10-27
From the first shot to the last, you feel that tremendous security you get when you are sure that the filmmaker is in total control of his material.	2013-10-27
Director Paul Greengrass mixes gritty realism with some stirring military ops for an edge of the seat piracy thriller	2013-10-26
It's also some of the most naked propaganda you'll see this side of Party Posse's "Join the Navy" from The Simpsons.	2013-10-26
Hanks' extraordinary acting in the last few scenes, from when he's bound and trapped at gunpoint in a bobbing claustrophobic lifeboat to the finale, will earn the two-time Oscar-winner his sixth nomination.	2013-10-26
Director Paul Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray have a much broader focus than one man's heroism.	2013-10-25
This is what piracy is now really like. In truth, it was probably always like this.	2013-10-25
Surprisingly, it's a very effective and entertaining thriller, with a few moments even better than that.	2013-10-24
An edge-of-your-seat cat-and-mouse game for much of its running time.	2013-10-24
Tom Hanks is in top form as the hero of this fact based drama.	2013-10-24
Captain Phillips not just an exceptional tale of grace under pressure, but an actively engaging experience as well.	2013-10-24
There is still an authenticity to the performances that mannered writing cannot undo.	2013-10-24
The situation is emblematic of the inequality that was the impetus for the pirates' crimes. Even in waters off the coast of their African homeland, they are as inconsequential as corks in the wake of the roused American behemoth.	2013-10-23
An experience that feels like having a gun held to your head. Compelling, ruthless and morally challenging. An astonishing piece of work.	2013-10-23
Nail-biting and fleet-footed (133-minute films don't go by any faster) and genuinely suspenseful even though a hugely lopsided portion of its audience already knows how things end.	2013-10-21
This antagonistic yet somehow respectuful relationship between the two skippers gives Captain Phillips its twist: we knew to expect a white-knuckle cinematic experience from this director, but not such a uniquely challenging relationship drama too.	2013-10-21
Something's missing: human interest.	2013-10-21
This film lives and breathes on the enthusiasm of its main character. Jodorowsky's passion for his craft is infectious and inspiring. Otherwise, it's a strictly routine affair.	2014-05-30
Why did it leave me so oddly happy, this story of a beautiful dream that never came true? Perhaps because there's beauty in the dreaming itself.	2014-05-30
Aside from Jodorowsky's Dune being spectacularly entertaining and intriguing, as well as flat-out surprising, it also contains wonderful themes, worth carrying into any aspect of life.	2014-05-28
Coulda been a contender: the Dune that never was	2014-05-23
A funny, fascinating rumination on art, ambition and the fickleness of fate. It's also unique in the history of film: a documentary that goes behind the scenes of a movie for which not a single scene was ever shot.	2014-05-14
Frank Pavich's new documentary on the obsessive Chilean surrealist's projected epic masterwork is very nearly as marvelous as "Jodo"'s adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel might have been.	2014-05-08
Jodorowsky's vision of Dune still exists from whence it sprang: the realm of dreams, where its visionary power is still pure potential energy.	2014-05-08
This documentary version of Jodorowsky's "Dune" is probably more entertaining than what Hollywood would have done to it, with a clearer message: Our lives are like sands though an hourglass, so dream the impossible dream.	2014-05-08
Entertaining from its first outrageous pronouncement of messianic intent to its final concept painting of a reticulated spaceship spilling outer-space spice...	2014-05-05
The story is something that could only happen in the 1970s. This was a time where Hollywood - and the world at large - were taking some significant risks.	2014-05-02
That's the beauty of a documentary like Jodorowsky's Dune. It does a fascinating job of playing "what if?" without ever having to fully give in and realize it.	2014-05-02
A deeply moving testament to single-minded, indefatigable commitment of creative vision and to an almost spiritual ability to let that vision go, thereby allowing it to exist in the world in an entirely unexpected form.	2014-05-01
A fascinating and inspiring documentary that offers a tantalizing look at what could have been.	2014-04-30
Imagining what if can be fun, especially when you consider the talent and vision the cult director envisioned for Herbert's interstellar epic.	2014-04-30
The evidence presented in this film does suggest that, at the very least, Jodorowsky would have made a hallucinatory, one-of-a-kind epic that, for better or worse, would still be heavily discussed to this day.	2014-04-26
An upbeat celebration of movie love and the creative process, brimming with entertaining anecdotes about 1970s Hollywood and what it's like to work with a mad (but very friendly) genius.	2014-04-25
The most enjoyable behind-the-scenes look at moviemaking to come along in ages. It's even better because it's about a movie that never was.	2014-04-25
'If you fail, it's not important. We need to try.'	2014-04-24
Jodorowsky is a mesmerizing presence in director Frank Pavich's engrossing picture. He was 84 when much of it was shot.	2014-04-24
This entertaining, uncritical documentary looks at a visionary director's quest to create the ultimate film from Frank Herbert's novel.	2014-04-24
Jodorowsky's Dune gives you a good sense of what might have been, and judging by what we see, the picture might have accomplished what the director ultimately intended: "To mutate young minds."	2014-04-24
The highlight of [the film] is the sheer enthusiasm of Alejandro Jodorowsky who viewed his acquisition of Frank Herbert's Dune as less of a film project and more as a life changing event.	2014-04-24
Jodorowsky's enthusiasm is infectious, and the movie makes a strong case that his ideas, though never realized, ended up permeating later sci-fi movies.	2014-04-23
... it's nice to dream, and Jodorwosky certainly offers up a wondrous image of what might have been.	2014-04-19
What an extraordinary dream it could have been.	2014-04-18
A movie about the greatest movie never made, and the man who never made it.	2014-04-17
It leaves you wondering about how many artists are working on such wild dreams these days, and hoping it's more than you think.	2014-04-17
"distinguishes itself by finding true inspiration in the shattered fragments of what was left."	2014-04-12
minor hyperbole	2014-04-10
Few of us get to change the world, but fewer still have the vision and ambition of Jodorowsky, and it's a heady thrill just to be in his orbit for a little while.	2014-04-10
A taste of what might have been--and even if you doubt that the completed film would have been as remarkable as Jodorowsky and his admirers are inclined to claim, it's a tantalizing taste.	2014-04-10
It's an outstanding combination of genius and missed opportunities.	2014-04-10
Somehow it only makes sense that one of the best making-of-documentaries ever made is about a movie that actually wasn't (made, that is).	2014-04-09
The epitome of a movie nerd's pipe dream.	2014-04-04
The best way to watch this movie is as an account of an eccentric visionary maverick who could not be stopped or influenced by reason ...	2014-04-04
We get an idea of what could have been via the colossal illustrated screenplay still lovingly held by Jodorowsky, who is every bit the dreamer in his 80s that he was in his youth.	2014-04-03
Jodorowsky's Dune isn't just a movie about an aborted adaptation of a cult science-fiction novel, it's a documentary that offers the missing link between modern sci-fi spectacle and the drug-induced psychedelia of the 1960s.	2014-04-03
Is Alejandro Jodorowsky's "Dune" the most influential movie never made?	2014-04-03
Employing a mix of lively talking-head interviews and trippy animation based on Jodorowsky's sketchbooks and storyboards, Frank Pavich's documentary paints a tantalizing picture of the movie that might have been.	2014-04-03
Fascinating. But calling it "the greatest movie ever made"? Fanboy, please...	2014-04-01
85-year old Alejandro Jodorowsky lights up the screen with his still-young sense of humor and the obvious passion he still holds for the project that never was.	2014-03-30
The film is a wealth of anecdotes ... told by people who are still enthusiastic about the project and still in disbelief that it failed to come to fruition.	2014-03-28
We're free to imagine what might have been, and in doing so, Jodorowsky's Dune is fun, occasionally mind-blowing hooey.	2014-03-27
Frank Savich's diverting documentary lets the 85-year-old filmmaker revisit a saga from the mid-'70s: his stellar two-year failure to adapt Frank Herbert's Dune for the screen.	2014-03-27
A great seminar on creativity.	2014-03-27
His stories feature an impressive roster of would-be collaborators (Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, H.R. Geiger, and Pink Floyd), and some of the set pieces he describes sound pretty neat.	2014-03-27
Pavich's movie is more profound as a tribute to the imagination of visionary directors who can't realize their visions.	2014-03-27
"Jodorowsky's Dune" is a lovely little tribute to a major league "What if?"	2014-03-27
Tickles the imaginations of movie fans who see the art form as an unlimited opportunity to expand the mind.	2014-03-27
The best parts of Jodorowsky's Dune explain just how a mad genius like Jodorowsky almost made the impossible possible, just by declaring it to be so.	2014-03-24
This kind of crime film is not easy to make, and the Edgertons have done an admirable job with The Square.	2010-09-03
The Square gets plenty of early elements in place to promise something more special than it ultimately becomes... Even a strong first impression can't survive such a flailing resolution.	2010-08-30
"The Square": It's Australian for noir, mate.	2010-08-26
A debut feature that replaces the Coen brothers' humor in similarly labyrinthine comedies of errors with Arthur Penn's grit and Peckinpah's tense string tuning.	2010-07-16
A taut, well-executed if somewhat predictable riff on the murderous caper-that-goes-wrong theme that has anchored sexy, blood-stained crime pictures from The Postman Always Rings Twice to Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.	2010-07-15
Dire, frantic, and unfailingly engaging...introduces a major filmmaking talent to the scene who understands the utter joy that comes with detailing complete psychological devastation.	2010-07-14
A well-made and entertaining descent into a black-comic hell.	2010-07-06
It's as if filmmaking brothers Joel and Nash Edgerton (Joel cowrote, produced and costars, Nash directed) sat down and said, "Let's watch these suckers wreck their lives, and the lives of everyone around them."	2010-07-06
A perverse delight, the rare film that makes you feel good about feeling bad (or at least watching others do so).	2010-06-22
A tough, twisty tale of murder, adultery and purloined loot that stays true to author James Ellroy's succinct summation of the primary theme of film noir: 'We're all ----ed.'	2010-06-11
The Edgertons are in complete command of their craft, without bringing anything new to the party.	2010-06-02
Slick compared to films noir of old, the stunts too cool and characters too swishy, but swaggering with a good old-fashioned edge and raw steaming action for each and every one of its 105 minutes.	2010-05-27
The movie's protagonists (and all of its supporting characters) are reprehensible people, and Roberts' performance is fascinatingly uncharismatic, extinguishing any possibility of sympathy for his character even when the film gradually reveals his town to	2010-05-26
In terms of a modern crime thriller, you're not going to do any better than this debut film.	2010-05-26
While the performances are good, it felt like I had already seen this movie before. Also, if you are looking to root for anyone, you're going to have to look elsewhere.	2010-05-22
The Square recalls one of cinema's all-time classic lines, that moment in 1981's Body Heat when Kathleen Turner's femme fatale Matty Walker studies William Hurt's gullible Ned Racine and declares, "You're not too smart, are you? I like that in a man."	2010-05-21
Rather than intrigue, the pile-up of confounding issues in The Square merely bores, hindered by pacing that is uniformly slow rather than suspenseful. A better title: The Blob.	2010-05-21
What's to be admired is how fearlessly Edgerton embraces the dirt and grime oozing out of "The Square," manufacturing the guilt that's produced when information is withheld, when lies are tossed around, and when the best laid plans go awry.	2010-05-21
A fiendishly gripping thriller.	2010-05-20
The whole thing unfolds with sadistic precision, but Edgerton's expert manipulation makes it a fun ride nonetheless.	2010-05-20
The low-budget Australian thriller actually gets crazier and more off-beat as it goes. It's worth it just to watch things spiral so far out of control.	2010-05-20
...delivers both a gallows wit and biblical sense of justice, punishing the lovers at every turn, which actually works against the piece.	2010-05-17
The Square grinds on you. Hard.	2010-05-15
Things go from bad to worse to downright disastrous in the enthralling Australian import The Square.	2010-05-14
The Square is a solidly constructed thriller with some missing pieces at the center but vivid splashes of color outside the lines.	2010-05-13
A familiar but gripping spiral down the sloppy-criminals rabbit hole.	2010-05-07
The Square suggests an exciting future for a pair of brothers with a dark view of pitiless fate.	2010-05-07
The Square announces the arrival of a new talent worth watching.	2010-05-07
When the first 10 minutes of film introduce us to an illicit affair, a kickback scheme, and a hidden bag filled with money, we know we're in for a twisty thriller.	2010-05-06
A mostly winning homage...Isn't just a film noir; it's so complicated an example of the genre that you might call it a film noir squared.	2010-05-06
This brain teaser is tightly edited, cleverly plotted and smartly written. It is lacking in character development and leaves out the sexual gymnastics.	2010-04-30
You needn't like the characters in a noir thriller as long as you're immersed in their growing desperation.	2010-04-30
The Square is a morality noir in which there's very little onscreen morality.	2010-04-30
A riveting tale of a small group of people doing very bad (and pretty dumb) things, The Square works from beginning to end and stands as one of the best feature debuts of the year to date.	2010-04-30
Some have called this neo-noir, but aside from the setting there's nothing "neo" about it; as in classic noir, the characters are slowly but surely ensnared by their own baser impulses.	2010-04-29
This refreshingly realistic movie's X factor is keeping things low-key as guilt spreads like a virus.	2010-04-29
The string-along, bad-to-worse nature of The Square affords a distinct, if sour, sort of satisfaction. Yet its construction is a thing of considerable soundness.	2010-04-29
The Square moves with implacable logic toward catastrophe, as its desperate heroes try to squirm out of a tightening noose.	2010-04-29
Edgerton makes it a point to complicate each character and action, focusing on complex decisions that produce lasting and often violent consequences.	2010-04-25
Let's just say it's a sour, poorly scripted mess of a thriller and leave it at that.	2010-04-23
There's a bit of everything in The Square, so much so that after a while it starts to feel generic.	2010-04-22
The dramatic structure is familiar, but the characters don't fit neatly into the usual pigeonholes.	2010-04-22
Every once in a while, a no-frills firecracker comes along to give film noir a kick in the pants, and The Square is the latest example.	2010-04-22
Superlative Australian neo-noir has everything you'd ever need for a delightfully dismal tale of deceit and murder.	2010-04-22
The marvelous script is a work of art and its execution is nothing short of phenomenal for a tyro director. It has taken a couple of years for this intelligent little gem to reach our shores but it is worth the wait.	2010-04-20
The Square is a terrific film noir with an Aussie twist.	2010-04-16
It will be interesting -- and exciting -- to see what the Edgerton brothers come up with next.	2010-04-16
There isn't a character in The Square you can care about, beyond pity for their foolishness and exasperation with their greed.	2010-04-16
It's a finely calibrated, spiraling lesson in what not to do when engaging in adultery, blackmail, arson, and general antisocial behaviors, and in its best moments it recalls the everyday darkness of James M. Cain.	2010-04-16
You wonder how the characters could be so inept about their dirty deeds. How did they get so badly in over their heads? It's almost Biblical in the way it metes out rough justice.	2010-04-16
Despite the cadaverous appearance of its lead actor, Dallas Buyers Club wants to be pretty, too, presenting a tidy, uplifting history of the years when unconscionable inaction and prejudice toward those with AIDS were a matter of federal policy.	2014-05-22
Who cares about the issues when you have unforgettable characters like these?	2014-05-15
Dallas Buyers Club is an example of American enterprise in an era in which the quality is perhaps not as evident as in the past.	2014-05-14
"Surprisingly balanced, in terms of the way it treats its characters and concepts."	2014-05-12
Lightweight, but not trivial; funny, but not cheap; moving, but not pathetic.	2014-03-13
The movie isn't simply well acted or written; all of its observant qualities and pitch perfect performances are married to a tone and method that are courageous in conviction.	2014-03-01
Nao e apenas um estudo de personagem, apresentando-se tambem como um retrato angustiante de uma epoca.	2014-02-22
Films can be lifted by their performances, just as careers can be resurrected by the embrace of difficult choices. Though grounded by a resonant real-life story of struggle and survival, Dallas Buyers Club offers an example of both.	2014-02-21
This incredible film charts one man's determination to stay alive against astounding odds and, most tantalisingly, supporting the very people that he despised.	2014-02-21
Leto almost steals the show, while Jennifer Garner represents stability as the gutsy hospital medic in a film from director Jean-Marc Vallee that is well-paced, involving and thought-provoking.	2014-02-21
A powerfully moving film, and McConaughey's extraordinary physical transformation is much more than a stunt.	2014-02-18
It's trying to explore a lot of angles and it does a good job, as opposed to a great job.	2014-02-14
An uplifting story of undying hope and unlikely heroism.	2014-02-14
It's really the performances that make this more than just a high-class disease-of-the-week effort.	2014-02-14
What makes the film so special is its sense of defiance and its scabrous humour.	2014-02-14
McConaughey is so charismatic that, as a simple one-man-against-the-odds drama, Dallas Buyers Club is consistently engaging; almost, despite Woodroof's intentions, inspirational.	2014-02-14
Now, weight loss does not equal acting, but in this case it forms a central part of McConaughey's remarkable dedication to completely inhabiting this role.	2014-02-14
Exceptionally well-written and directed, this tough, yet tender-hearted film doesn't take the easy road towards winning your full respect and fascination.	2014-02-13
Let us praise, brothers and sisters, the era of the McConaisance.	2014-02-12
It's impossible not to like and McConaughey's Ron is a compelling screen creation, a skinny, crazy zealot whose relentless energy seems to come from nowhere.	2014-02-12
McConaughey and Leto drill down to the roots of their characters. It calls to mind that advice for actors playing drunk: you do it like you're emphatically sober. Neither man plays the disease. They play instead the rage to live.	2014-02-12
It's a testament to McConaughey's newly-resuscitated career that we can call this a minor entry in his increasingly impressive body of work.	2014-02-11
By turns ornery, obnoxious, dogged, canny, brave and compassionate, McConaughey is mesmerising to watch.	2014-02-10
Terrific performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto elevate this socio-medical drama out of the realms of the ordinary into something quietly remarkable.	2014-02-09
McConaughey sells it with absolute conviction.	2014-02-09
Former heart-throb turned indie king, Matthew McConaughey goes for broke with what could well be his most affecting on-screen turn yet.	2014-02-09
For all its occasional compromises, Dallas Buyers Club shakes off potential disease-of-the-month TV movie status and succeeds at an uncomplicated emotional level.	2014-02-08
The first thing you notice is McConaughey's radical weight loss, but his performance is equally worthy of attention and deserving of some serious recognition come awards season. Likewise his eighties 'tache.	2014-02-07
The performances are spectacular, McConaughey's especially, so alive in approaching death.	2014-02-07
In telling this remarkable true story, director Jean-Marc Vallee (The Young Victoria) and his gifted cast keep the characters and events so grounded that we can't help but get caught up in their story.	2014-02-07
His frame is slight, but Matthew McConaughey remains a hulking presence in this riveting true-life tale.	2014-02-07
In its rough ride though pharmaceuticals provision in 80s America, this well-acted, Oscar-baiting AIDS drama mixes a queer cocktail of rugged individualism and anti-corporate collectivism.	2014-02-07
How a reprobate womaniser, boozer, snorter and hustler made a difference .. and how an actor called Matthew McConaughey resurrected the remarkable spirit of Ron Woodroof, in a performance that swallows the actor - body and all	2014-02-06
Two stand-out performances and the claustrophobic depiction of a death-infested reality are the significant elements of Dallas Buyers Club. It's a tough film, based on a true story	2014-02-06
Thanks to a lack of heartstrings being insincerely tugged and magnetic performances from Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto ... familiarity never quite breeds contempt.	2014-02-06
We all love a rousing tale of perseverance against the odds, and Dallas Buyers Club offers two of them: one on the screen, and another behind the scenes.	2014-02-06
It would be a TV problem-of-the-week movie without McConaughey's skill in combining intelligence with pizzazz.	2014-02-06
It is fantastic and Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of his career. In fact, it may be the best performance of anyone's career. It'll blow your tiny minds. It blew my tiny mind.	2014-02-06
I have always been a huge fan of Matthew McConaughey even though many of his film roles have failed to showcase his considerable talent. But he finally comes of age with a sensational performance in his new film Dallas Buyers Club.	2014-02-06
Like McConaughey's Woodruff, it is honest and hard-edged and all the more powerful and absorbing for it, yet without sacrificing humour and heart ...	2014-02-06
A calculated prestige picture that never bothers to ask broader questions about the AIDS epidemic.	2014-02-06
An inspiring and powerfully emotional drama that would make an excellent double bill with recent AIDS doc How To Survive A Plague.	2014-02-06
Tough, poignant and ultimately life-affirming, this is the way Woodroof's tale deserved to be told.	2014-02-06
Like a Gary Cooper in the era of sexual crisis, McConaughey hits a very sure stride.	2014-02-06
A fascinating, if dated look at the AIDS crisis of the 1980's with a central moral that still applies today.	2014-02-03
Inevitably, there's a familiar redemptive arc to Dallas Buyers Club, but the crossover to altruism is so sneakily done here that it is irresistible.	2014-02-03
Get this - Matthew McConaughey is currently the most exciting acting talent at work in movies. Next up, the simple business of a Christopher Nolan.	2014-02-03
If not wholly convincing as an 'issues' movie, this memoir is a triumph as an actors' showcase; with McConaughey and Leto giving the performances of their careers.	2014-02-03
McConaughey brings a rough-around-the-edges humanity to his character...whose gradual transition from homophobic swindler to altruist is handled with a refreshing degree of nuance.	2014-02-03
The cold, documentary style puts the ball entirely in McConaughey's court. He plays it beautifully.	2014-02-01
[Grohl] has great fun sweeping through the historic parade of latter-day rock royalty whose hit records came out of the place.	2014-02-04
Sound City is a fun ride for diehard fans of most any brand of rock and roll.	2014-01-01
In Sound City, a raucous yet sweetly romantic documentary, dinosaurs do indeed rock the Earth again.	2014-01-01
A sincere tribute to the tape-based dumpy Sound City.	2013-12-19
When getting into the nitty-gritty of tapes and tracks, Grohl makes a strong case for music docs directed by musicians.	2013-12-16
Dave Grohl's terrific new doc, Sound City, profiles the studio where some of the greatest music of the past four decades was born.	2013-12-16
Dave Grohl shares a lot of stories in Sound City, and what's most impressive is that for a first-time filmmaker he tells these tales remarkably well.	2013-12-16
It's (a) part documentary homage to the defunct Los Angeles rock-and-roll studio where Grohl's earlier band, Nirvana, cut its breakout album, 'Nevermind'; and (b) part self-promotion for the DVD release of this very film and its companion CD soundtrack.	2013-04-15
It cheapens itself by hitting some self-congratulatory notes, but until it does it covers some fascinating rock 'n' roll ground.	2013-04-11
For those about to rock, we salute you. A fond acknowledgement of a special time when a studio produced several albums that signaled key moments in music history.	2013-03-29
An infectious appreciation for rock and roll lingers past the somewhat self-satisfied finale.	2013-03-19
There's something rock about the film's messy, nostalgic imperfection.	2013-03-15
Fascinating, as rock history, thrilling as rock entertainment.	2013-03-05
A joyous ode to a lost era of music making that will delight music buffs and those who appreciate a well-done documentary.	2013-02-21
Grohl has ... created both a fascinating account of the process of analogue recording and a tender tribute to the rock bands of yesteryear.	2013-02-19
A rich, kaleidoscopic, rock music documentary.	2013-02-08
A cocky, affectionate and very musical documentary that may make its central point a few times too often.	2013-02-07
A total blast to watch, sustaining momentum with a sharp admiration for the thrilling highs and lows of the complex and its rich history with some of the biggest artists around.	2013-02-07
It's a sprawling documentary that laments what's been lost in analog recording without ignoring the benefits of technology.	2013-02-05
Loving doc about a legendary recording studio is one of the very best-and quite essential-movies about rock music ever made.	2013-02-04
... offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the studio, but in the process chronicles a recent history of rock music that both fans and non-fans can appreciate.	2013-02-04
An authoritative, beautifully assembled, personal, even romantic account of one of rock music's most important waypoints, a film which aficionados absolutely should not miss.	2013-02-03
In his directing debut, Dave Grohl shows the instincts of a real filmmaker. Sound City hits you like a shot in the heart.	2013-02-02
Even if you don't know what [Grohl's] talking about when he says a room gives "great decay," or when somebody else extols "24-track sensibility," the passion of this project really pops right out of the groove.	2013-02-01
If it doesn't break any ground as a documentary, it's a heartfelt testament to a place he considers among the most hallowed halls of rock.	2013-02-01
An electrifying and enthralling labor of love that acts as a defibrillator for your creative juices.	2013-02-01
High-spirited, emotional and funny, "Sound City" is, of all things, a mash note to a machine. Not just any machine, however, but one that helped change the face of rock 'n' roll.	2013-01-31
A celebration of just how unbelievably awesome it is to make rock music for a living - not to mention being so successful at it that you can get your childhood heroes to come over and jam.	2013-01-31
Grohl's aim is to explore the aura of a place, but what he winds up proving is that people make the magic.	2013-01-31
I didn't jump out of my chair and pump my fist till 24 minutes in.	2013-01-31
Dave Grohl remains unflappable as a first-time director in his entertaining and informative documentary Sound City, a loving tribute to a defunct Van Nuys recording studio.	2013-01-31
Mr. Grohl has put a lot of affection into this film, and it shows.	2013-01-30
Given Dave Grohl's reputation for versatility and good taste, the film's sturdy sense of forward motion may come as no surprise.	2013-01-30
Grohl treats us to just more than an hour celebrating the history of Sound City, the Van Nuys dump where a clutch of rock's great records were bashed out-but the movie's 107 minutes long.	2013-01-29
The first-time director smartly sees Sound City as a surrogate for the overall industry at any given point in the past four decades, and he varies the tone of the interviews from fondly-regarded serendipity to deep-seated regret.	2013-01-29
The beautiful thing here is the way Sound City enlivens some fairly snobby ideas about the glories of analog tape without resorting to mere mansplaining.	2013-01-29
It's a mismanaged balancing act (hey, sort of like having a band!), but it's an entertaining flick and rocking rock history nonetheless.	2013-01-29
A comprehensive look into the recording process and how it has changed over the years (and continues to change) while taking audiences on a journey from where music was in the '70s to where it is today.	2013-01-29
An exhilarating history of the studio that spawned countless rock classics, not to mention a welcome reminder to aspiring musicians to step away from the laptop once in a while.	2013-01-24
The film is an exhilarating exploration of the creative process.	2013-01-23
We know Dave Grohl is a great drummer and an incredible frontman; now we know he's a great documentary filmmaker too...	2013-01-19
There is something almost spiritual in the eerie importance that all the ordinary, banal facts of a life achieve under scrutiny, as time is running out.	2014-06-05
Why is goodhearted liberal cinema sometimes so dumb?	2014-06-05
Coogler's spare, sombre style serves the story well, skillfully avoiding cliche and formula to soberly rage against a grave miscarriage of justice.	2014-06-05
The emotionally wrenching Fruitvale Station doesn't feel like a call-to-arms so much as a call against them.	2014-06-05
Just... no. This is heartstring-tugging hooey.	2014-06-05
It's an emotive film about an emotive incident, but an unmolested account of Grant's demise could have had so much more impact.	2014-06-04
This chronicle of a death foretold celebrates an individual's efforts to do better even as it laments his - and his nation's - difficulties in moving on.	2014-06-04
It's ragged around the edges, but this remains a stirring tribute to Grant. And coaxed by the assured Coogler, Jordan delivers a performance that will long be remembered.	2014-06-02
A deeply moving drama played out on the small stage of ordinary people's lives.	2014-06-02
A tragic, grievous subject matter handled delicately and efficiently.	2014-04-28
Anchored by what deservedly proved to be a breakthrough turn for Jordan, Fruitvale Station is a devastating and detailed celebration of life.	2014-04-25
A captivating film ...	2014-04-24
Potentially blunt dramaturgy turns to something profound (and not perfumed) in implication.	2014-04-08
An impressive debut by Ryan Coogler.	2014-03-09
Fruitvale Station does work, but it's marred by problematic writing and direction.	2014-02-20
As a first feature for writer/director Ryan Coogler, it's pretty remarkable. As a star-making vehicle for Michael B. Jordan, it's a slam dunk.	2014-02-06
Fruitvale Station is centered around a tragic event with a powerful message, but just lacks the momentum to actually be impressive.	2014-01-14
Fruitvale Station nos lembra de que somos todos Oscar Grant.	2013-12-30
As a biographical drama Fruitvale Station works, though you're not going to pick up anything about the actual shooting that you don't already know.	2013-12-17
Michael B. Jordan is simply brilliant in his portrayal of Grant, whom Coogler presents as a generally happy, if complex and somewhat troubled young man.	2013-12-10
If Coogler were not as sure a directorial hand, or the film less gripping, that weight might be too much for it to bear. But, despite some imperfections, they're both up to the task.	2013-12-10
The intimacy of debut writer-director Ryan Coogler's approach to the film and the no-frills, believably real quality of the main performances combine to drive the senselessness of Oscar's killing home with visceral impact.	2013-12-10
Critically, Fruitvale Station serves as a morality tale that reminds us not to dismiss anyone without first knowing the full story behind the scenes. Every life has value.	2013-12-10
Writer-director Ryan Coogler's [film is an] assured and evenhanded debut.	2013-12-10
A runaway powerhouse film packed with emotionally-gripping performances, outstanding direction and a script that challenges viewers like few other films have this year.	2013-12-03
Not just Jordan, but everyone from the likes of Octavia Spencer and Melonie Diaz to the crowd of BART-passenger bit players hit it convincingly, consistently.	2013-11-27
Well-meaning, naturally acted, horrifically unbalanced...Whatever its objectives, the film comes across as an emotionally exploitative, crudely manipulative prayer.	2013-11-08
Make no mistake: there's a rage and wrenching sadness here, but Ryan Coogler has filtered it via a story packed with lingering grace notes.	2013-11-05
When it reaches that harrowing, inevitable finale, it inspires fury and confusion much like Spike Lee's signature work did two decades ago.	2013-11-04
The best thing Coogler did was cast Michael B. Jordan as Oscar and Octavia Spencer as his mother Wanda and surround them with an entirely credible version of life in Oakland's black community.	2013-11-04
Despite its credibility issues, the film is still able to deliver an emotional finale.	2013-11-03
Riveting, emotionally charged drama, with powerhouse performances to match. Jordan is a revelation.	2013-11-03
Thank goodness ... for the performances, all powerful and compelling, from Michael B. Jordan as Oscar to the wonderful Octavia Spencer as his mum and Melonie Diaz as his gf Sophina	2013-11-02
it rings true. There is no manipulation or theatrical construct that deflect from the story's core; the film ensures Oscar's legacy remains and that we feel as though we have got to know this young man whose loss is a senseless tragedy	2013-11-02
Assured directorial debut of the 26-year-old Ryan Coogler.	2013-09-25
It's an unflinching, 360-degree character portrait.	2013-09-22
A good first film but not quite deserving of the hype. The best parts have nothing to do with Oscar Grant's murder but the quotidian tale of survival by a young man with the best of intentions.	2013-08-26
does something more radical ... humanizes the protagonist	2013-08-24
Stunning, timely look at the killing of an unarmed man	2013-08-21
...takes tragedies that have inflamed a nation - from Fruitvale to Sanford, Fla. - and brings them back down to human scale.	2013-08-11
There are scenes that were certainly fabricated for the movie, but the emotional truth behind them feels real.	2013-08-09
An utterly moving and rich slice-of-life fable.	2013-08-07
Yet, despite being aware of the outcome, the movie is, in its own profane and streetwise manner, a warmhearted and soulful story of a young man's journey toward self-discovery and determination.	2013-08-06
An impressive launch for the film's young writer-director and a signal that the movie's leading man will be a major presence in American film.	2013-08-02
The performance by Michael B. Jordan is authentic and convincing, and helps us stay engaged in a film that wants to be mundane until its explosive finale.&#8233;	2013-08-02
In the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict, this compassionate film reclaims the humanity of victims transformed into political symbols and provides context for those who think the media and not Zimmerman's bullet 'injected race' into the Martin killing.	2013-08-01
One of the year's best films.	2013-08-01
This dramatic story is told in a fair and balanced way, supplemented with excellent acting.	2013-07-31
A powerful acknowledgement of existence	2013-07-30
It's funny how the bloated, overly lengthy studio blockbusters have far less impact than 90 minutes of a relatively brief, CGI-free 'little' movie such as 'Fruitvale Station.'	2013-07-29
Chandor never overplays his hand, and in doing so he creates a worthy portrait of a man in a dire situation that resonates with us all.	2014-05-05
once Robert Redford is on screen, his muted, exasperated, hopeful performance is an exemplar of the physical. Our Man seems a man of reckless wealth and expansive estrangement: why is he at sea? Begging the larger question, why are we all at sea?	2014-04-05
A commanding performance by Robert Redford with nary a word spoken. It makes up for the somewhat tedious running time.	2014-03-24
Superb, a brilliantly conceived, first-person masterpiece, totally immersive and compelling from first frame to last. It's easily one of the best survival films ever made, even with Gravity dominating everybody's praise.	2014-03-09
O rosto envelhecido, marcado e expressivo (e ainda belo) de Redford comunica uma infinidade de ideias e sentimentos com o minimo esforco.	2014-03-07
Mark his name down as one to watch. Chandor could potentially turn out to be as fresh and innovative a talent of the likes of Christopher Nolan and Spike Jonze in the near future.	2014-03-06
This works just fine viewed as a stripped back tale of survival against the odds. The ending is the only moment where the metaphorical comes to the fore, and even then it's really just a matter of how literally you want to take the title.	2014-03-05
This film makes an excellent case that sometimes less can be so much more.	2014-03-05
A subtle meditation on mind, body and spirit that's imbued with an aching amount of futility and loneliness	2014-03-04
The low tech nature of All is Lost accentuates the primal (physical) nature of this struggle, while the technical prowess of Gravity emphasizes its more metaphysical (and less interesting) nature	2014-03-04
All is Lost makes the familiar strikingly new. The filmmaker and his star hold their nerve, refusing easy outs and making you look - and listen - carefully to a starkly pure piece of cinema.	2014-03-04
If you're slightly intrigued by the premise, find the time to see All Is Lost. It's taking a chance and trying to give us something different.	2014-03-02
Full of detail, the film is almost claustrophobic at times as we stay inside the cabin of the yacht while the ocean heaves outside, the wind howls, the boat shrieks... it's a unique work	2014-03-01
Uncluttered by narrative or dialogue, Robert Redford gives an astounding performance - spending most of the film literally and psychologically hanging on	2014-03-01
It's a rare example of pure cinema, and that, in itself, gives it a stature to which few Hollywood films these days aspire.	2014-02-28
Chandor has produced a minimalist gem.	2014-02-28
This is the most compelling tale of nautical peril since Steven Spielberg's Jaws.	2014-02-21
'Captain Phillips' wasn't the only see-worthy vessel of 2013.	2014-02-21
We (and he) know he's screwed. The tension comes from establishing just how badly.	2014-02-20
Chandor clearly wanted to make something powerful and engrossing, but due to the simplistic nature of the film, what he ended up with was something dull and forgettable.	2014-02-10
The film attains an operatic grandeur in its closing moments, and surprisingly earns it: Chandor's intensely physical, experiential work has brought us right up to the perilous edge between life and death.	2014-02-06
The most remarkable feat in J.C. Chandor's stranded-in-the-sea survival story All Is Lost is star Robert Redford's ability to shave on open water.	2014-02-02
The Old Man IN the Sea!	2014-01-26
(Redford) is quite effective in the film's slower moments, while thoroughly rattled when reacting to the elements.	2014-01-14
So threadbare that there's nothing to grasp onto to care about.	2014-01-11
We've seen this story before, but Chandor dares to construct it so far from convention, and, surprisingly, it resonates come closer to home in the process.	2014-01-05
A drama full of intrigue, built on close identification with the imperilled floater.	2014-01-03
Gravity's great weakness was the unnecessarily abundant corny dialogue. All Is Lost is makes no such compromises.	2014-01-01
As the film goes on, we see Redford in a new light. A light dimmer and paler and murkier. Once a golden god on screen, there now remains a hobbled everyman.	2013-12-31
Who is this sailor? Where does he come from? Chandor never sees fit to tell us. His hero remains a deliberate stencil, defined solely by the crisis around him and the actions he takes.	2013-12-30
the film generates a wonderful sense of claustrophobia on the open sea. Imagine a movie with the lyrical beauty of a Terrence Malick project crossed with the virtuosity of Tom Hanks in Cast Away.	2013-12-27
Technically, this is a hugely impressive film but it still left me feeling a little underwhelmed.	2013-12-27
[Redford] speaks barely a handful of lines in All Is Lost, but the film still manages to feel like an internal monologue, a conversation between one man and himself.	2013-12-26
The utter solitude is almost vertiginous.	2013-12-26
Chandor's movie gives us the Hemingwayish essentials and then some.	2013-12-26
There's something powerful lurking in the deep.	2013-12-24
Impressively paced and superbly shot, this is a powerful and ultimately terrifying drama with stunning sound design work and an Oscar-worthy performance from Robert Redford.	2013-12-24
At a time when filmmakers are desperately throwing everything at the screen and seeing what sticks, it's refreshing to see a film like All Is Lost come along and turn the more-is-more formula on its head.	2013-12-24
This beautifully-directed drama succeeds to a certain experimental extent but drags on for a bit too long.	2013-12-24
If you are a big Robert Redford fan you should eat this movie up since he is the only person in the movie. The downside, he is the only person in the movie.	2013-12-23
With no 3D, no friends and no hope, Redford and Chandor show how survivalist instincts can stoke thrilling, thoughtful cinema.	2013-12-23
A very beautiful and intense piece of survival drama...	2013-12-21
After the award-winning Margin Call, writer-director J.C. Chandor shifts gears completely for this fiercely detailed one-man survival drama.	2013-12-20
[Redford] gives a commanding performance as the nameless protagonist that makes the complete lack of characterisation an irrelevance.	2013-12-20
All Is Lost is very pure film-making, set entirely on the water, without dialogue, just showing us the man's fight to survive from moment to moment.	2013-12-20
the Cliffs Notes version of the deeper, more profound character study that never transpires on-screen	2013-12-17
This is one man, alone, facing death. Redford is playing himself, and he's not playing around.	2013-12-16
It's the detail and precision of his storytelling style that makes All Is Lost so engrossing.	2013-12-16
[Redford] brings both physicality and emotion to the role, subtly shifting from anger to surprise to despair. It's a completely naturalistic performance, stripped of ego or artifice, and you often forget you're watching a Hollywood icon.	2013-12-16
It's not as tense as Gravity, but just as suspenseful, and almost as exhilarating.	2013-12-16
What might have been a guilty pleasure is anything but thanks to badly-staged action scenes and a script that resembles a tick-list of action-flick cliches.	2014-02-07
CRASH. "Slow down!" CRASH. "Pull over!" "Do it. Now!" CRASH.	2014-02-06
If movies need us to suspend disbelief, you have to supply your own clothes hangers for Getaway.	2014-01-03
With its smashy-crashy aesthetic and endless scenes of hyperbolic car-nage, Getaway exhausts the viewer's patience long before the finishing line approaches.	2013-12-08
It's watchable enough, but you wouldn't want to pay cinema prices for the pleasure.	2013-12-06
One of the worst films of the year, by a country mile.	2013-12-06
If you want to see a film make any kind of sense - or at least not to profit from attacking scores of others with a high-speed vehicle on the assumption you might save one person - then run for your life.	2013-12-06
You watch the resultant, wholly bloodless carnage with brain in neutral and eyes glazing over, as you would a re-run of Police, Camera, Action! at two in the morning.	2013-12-05
Undeniably silly and riddled with both gaping plot holes and unintentionally laughable moments ...	2013-12-05
Little more than a series of repetitious chases that ploughs through the cliches like so many piled-up boxes, barrels, crates and Christmas trees. All that's missing is some blokes trying to cross the street with a plate glass window.	2013-12-05
It's difficult to know quite what is harder to believe. The completely illusory and nonsensical nature of the absurd narrative Getaway or Ethan Hawke was able to make this in the same year he shone in Before Midnight!	2013-12-05
A witless and unforgivably tame car wreck.	2013-12-02
Filmed on the cheap in Bulgaria, it makes up for what it lacks in originality with a plethora of well-staged car-stunts, and puts action firmly at the centre of its limited appeal.	2013-12-02
Getaway should be required viewing for any filmmaker considering making a car chase movie. It offers a virtual step-by-step tutorial on what not to do.	2013-11-23
A movie on the road to nowhere	2013-10-18
If the title ended in an exclamation point, this movie's very title would be a warning. 'Getaway,' which is nothing so much as an hour-and-a-half car chase, is preposterously silly.	2013-09-28
This latter-day B movie can be rather fun in its preposterousness and bargain-basement style.	2013-09-19
Wanting desperately to be Fast & Furious, Getaway is more like the schizophrenic cousin to 12 Rounds.	2013-09-15
A big clotted clog of fumes and dust and grit, inane dialogue, ridiculous plotting, and bent, twisted metal.	2013-09-09
The plot holes are huge, most notably one that the writers stole directly from "Speed."	2013-09-07
You expect [Gomez] to hold up her fingers on both hands and shout, "I'M THIS MANY!"	2013-09-06
Tiresome wannabe thriller, incoherently spinning its wheels for 97 minutes with sheer stupidity.	2013-09-06
Ethan Hawke can drive. He can also act. I'm just not sure he can do both at the same time.	2013-09-05
Hey...please don't do anything like this to us again. Thank you.	2013-09-04
You know you are in trouble when Selena Gomez' character is the smartest one in the film.	2013-09-03
Not even bad enough to be enjoyable. It's just plain bad.	2013-09-03
Accomplishes the impressive task of vanishing completely from your mind as you're sitting in the theater watching it.	2013-09-02
"White House Down" all is forgiven! "Getaway" crashes into theaters as the summer's worst movie.	2013-09-02
A Really Boring Dud	2013-09-01
I read how 130 cars were crashed during filming. 130! They could give one as compensation to everyone who pays money to see this textbook late summer dump in the theater.	2013-09-01
It's a car movie made by people who couldn't find reverse in a Volkswagen; a puzzle box thriller assembled by the functionally insane.	2013-08-30
Apparently paid by the word, Gomez infuses her never-ending word bubbles with all the emotion and gravitas of a tweet declaring her disdain for pumpkin-flavored lattes.	2013-08-30
If you've always wanted to see Ethan Hawke bicker with a teenage girl for 90 minutes, this is your chance.	2013-08-30
Getaway is pretty much a 90-minute car chase. That's it.	2013-08-30
"Getaway" will actually have you laughing at several points. The problem is, I don't think that was the filmmaker's intention.	2013-08-30
The main concern for viewers will be whether the car survives all the mayhem, or at least whether insurance will cover all the damages.	2013-08-30
Selena Gomez is so laughably bad that Miley Cyrus twerking at the VMAs is only the second-most-awkward performance by a former Disney star this week.	2013-08-30
The direction is so amateurish that Getaway fails to even provide serviceable B-movie thrills.	2013-08-30
The only participant to emerge with its reputation intact--though not its paint job--is the Shelby Mustang muscle car, which also delivers the film's most nuanced and psychologically complex performance.	2013-08-30
It's as if the director saw a Paul Greengrass fight and figured excitement is the result of confusion and loud noises.	2013-08-30
The good news about "Getaway" is that it always uses real cars and drivers. The bad news is that it does not always use real actors or writers.	2013-08-30
Getaway has some of the crass trappings of a charmingly crass, go-for-broke action pic like the delightful Crank. But it's too dumb - and far too cynical about what audiences want - to even know how to have fun with them.	2013-08-30
Hawke compensates with a vivid, ferocious performance that doesn't go over the top.	2013-08-30
The characterization and dialogue are atrocious, the filmmaking is fashionably busy, and there's a lazy cynicism to the picture that sours its thrills.	2013-08-30
It may be the dumbest movie released this summer.	2013-08-30
For evidence that speed, mayhem and tumbling vehicles do not necessarily result in excitement, we present Getaway.	2013-08-30
'Bullitt' is still remembered after 40 years for its car chase that only lasted 10 minutes. 'Getaway' is a 90 minute car chase and it will be forgotten by the end of the year, if not sooner.	2013-08-30
It's an excuse for a 90-minute orgy of car chases and crashes that thoroughly tests the audience's endurance and patience.	2013-08-30
Lackluster action flick has too many smashed cars to count.	2013-08-30
For 89 minutes that feel like 89 hours, cars speed out of control and crash doing only PG-13 damage. The damage to your brain while watching it is incalculable.	2013-08-30
Here's a movie that's way, way, more interesting for the story behind it than for anything that actually happens on screen	2013-12-12
The greatest waste of A-list talent since Garry Marshall made his last film.	2013-06-30
It's got some clever sketches, though to really enjoy them, one must have the sense of humor of a 12-year-old boy. Fortunately, I do.	2013-06-24
It feels like somebody strung together some of the worst SNL skits and called it a film.	2013-06-21
a bad idea handled in a hackneyed manner.	2013-06-09
An execrable waste cooked up by a hell's kitchen of directors and writers. It's death-of-laughter by committee. Its title? Because it's like one of those many asteroids out there--a dismal chunk of rock hurtling through an empty void, without purpose.	2013-05-06
Being punched in the face was easier that watching this movie.	2013-04-08
To fully enjoy yourself from start to finish, it will help if you've got the sense of humor of a middle-school-aged sociopath... For the rest of you, I suggest eventually watching it on your phone.	2013-03-09
Absolutely disgusting, nauseating, misogynistic, racist, cruel, void of any common sense...	2013-03-01
It's a full-scale disaster, a misfire of megalithic proportions that somehow managed to snare an A-list cast...The reviews have been so relentlessly acidic that it could acquire a so-bad-it's-fun mystique that turns it into a cult film.	2013-02-15
The very fact that all gave so willingly of their time and talent to feature in such a grotesque spectacle is sort of endearing.	2013-02-07
Be afraid. Be very afraid.	2013-02-06
Despite all the gross-out humor, the most offensive thing about this is the lazy filmmaking; every shot feels like a first take, and the haphazard editing precludes any comic timing.	2013-02-04
It rather boggles the mind how so many micromanaging handlers allowed their A-list talent to participate in a production that looks funded from a frat-house's loose-couch-change collection.	2013-02-04
It is utterly disgusting throughout.	2013-02-04
If you're interested in seeing Oscar winners, Tony winners, and a bunch of genuinely talented people act out the raunchiest, most inappropriate material you're likely to see this year, Movie 43 fits the bill.	2013-02-04
As a film critic, I've seen nearly 4,000 movies over the last fifteen years. Right now, I can't think of one worse than Movie 43.	2013-02-04
Misconceived rag bag of potty-brained skits starring gullible big names including Kate Winslet, Richard Gere and Gerard Butler.	2013-02-04
The homeschooling segment is funny. The rest...not so much.	2013-02-03
It's tough to know how to begin addressing this swill of a so-called comedy.	2013-02-02
Sporadically funny yet terminally stupid...	2013-02-02
If approached by friends to see this disaster, feel free to repeat what a wise George Clooney reportedly said when asked by its producers to take part: "No ****ing way."	2013-02-01
As it turns out, watching actors who are otherwise likable, marketable and capable reduce themselves to this ridiculous pabulum isn't funny. It's depressing.	2013-02-01
This is nothing more than a chance to watch many of your favourite stars embarrassing themselves like 13-year-olds high on illicit booze.	2013-01-31
Don't subject yourself to this crap ...	2013-01-30
A black mark on the careers of everyone involved in this mess.	2013-01-30
A cameo parade of stars, some of whom have no obvious gift for comedy, try their hardest, but the laughs just aren't there.	2013-01-29
I was immediately overcome with a sudden rush of emotion: not amusement, anger or even mild irritation, but a profound and faintly tragic sense of pity.	2013-01-29
With so many famous people in one movie, you might have thought, 'Gee, how bad could it be?' The answer: Very, very bad.	2013-01-28
It just doesn't pay off the way it should, mainly because the gags are built on cheap laughs and the shock value of seeing famous people get dirty.	2013-01-28
There's certainly some surprises that earn genuine laughs, but as a whole the film has the feel of a bunch of SNL sketches in an off year that air after Weekend Update.	2013-01-28
This is barely a movie at all, mostly due to its structural similarities to SNL, but also because it acknowledges the fact that its own premises are inherently unfilmable.	2013-01-28
If this is the future of film-making then basically we're all doomed.	2013-01-28
How many directors does it take to screw in a star-studded piece of aggressive stupidity and call it a movie? An even dozen, and there is no punch line.	2013-01-28
The line between gross-out humor that's inspired and the kind that's witless is fine indeed, and "Movie 43" obliterates it with poop and movie stars.	2013-01-28
Movie 43" will earn a cult niche in cinema history if only for the film's bizarre coupling of high-octane talent with some of the worst comic ideas ever imagined.	2013-01-27
A punishing exercise in brain cell annihilation that shoots for edgy but mostly settles for inane petulance.	2013-01-27
[A]t one point, Dennis Quaid holds Greg Kinnear at gunpoint to sell his character's collection of short scenes, and it is the only genuinely honest moment in the movie.	2013-01-26
Dismal and witless, the worst picture I've seen in many, many years. Even if you wait for the DVD - and get it free - it's a waste of time.	2013-01-26
A disgusting, cinematic descent into depravity destined to leave its victims, sitting slack-jawed and speechless in stunned disbelief.	2013-01-26
Unlike &#8203;The &#8203;Kentucky Fried Movie, the brilliant &#8203;benchmark&#8203; that came before it, &#8203;Movie 43 &#8203;beats already tired scatalogical humor to death before taking another piss on the remains. It's really that bad.	2013-01-26
A total mess but not without its genuinely funny moments, this Relativity release is one to store away in the how-did-this-ever-happen vault.	2013-01-26
"Movie 43" is the "Citizen Kane" of awful.	2013-01-26
Movie 43 deserves at least some of the bad press it's getting, but don't be surprised if it sticks around a little longer than its detractors believe.	2013-01-26
A confounding crapfest that squanders a cast of stars that would put most award shows to shame on material that would be rightfully rejected from most third-grade recess periods for lacking the requisite wit and dignity.	2013-01-25
Deadly dull, unfunny, offensive, and stultifyingly clumsy.	2013-01-25
Movie 43 is a near masterpiece of tastelessness. The anthology of 12 short, interconnected skits elevates the art form of gross-out comedy to a new height.	2013-01-25
What's most offensive about Movie 43 isn't the scatological humor, but how shoddily the whole thing was put together.	2013-01-25
Once you're attuned to the movie's desperation to shock, you begin to have that jaded, ho-hum feeling.	2013-01-25
Just no.	2013-01-25
The writers are on auto pilot once more, relying on the "It's familiar, so it must be funny" routine...	2013-10-16
Scary Movie 5 is a reprehensible excuse of a comedy and should barely be considered a film since it's of such poor quality. They don't make a dunce cap big enough for individuals this idiotic.	2013-08-19
Railing against Scary Movie V for diminishing the series' standards would be as effective as criticising Brooke Hogan for disgracing her proud family name. And yet, the fifth instalment of the Scary Movie franchise does do that.	2013-08-15
A boldly uninspired torrent of halfhearted slapstick, interminable poop jokes, and pointless pop-culture references, a veritable tsunami of idiocy.	2013-07-12
Enough. Please.	2013-05-04
This is a big waste of time, drawing one more gasp out of a series that should have given up the ghost long ago.	2013-05-03
This franchise has steadily gotten worse and worse with #5 being the all time low.	2013-04-21
The only thing scary about 'Scary Movie 5' is the thought of a sequel.	2013-04-20
It's crude, gross and probably wishes it was offensive but comes across as just lazy, limp and unfunny.	2013-04-18
Don't. Don't go see this. Don't subject yourself to this. Don't subject your brain to this. Don't give these people your money and encourage them to make more of this.	2013-04-17
The filmmakers border on sophomoric desperation, achieving a measurable shred of humor only in the outtakes during the closing credits.	2013-04-16
A laughter vacuum whose race to parody the likes of Mama and the new Evil Dead remake didn't stretch to writing actual jokes.	2013-04-15
The latest installment of the slick, highly profitable parody franchise.	2013-04-14
It's supposed to be funny, but you'd have an easier time reading a zombie's pulse than you would finding a single good laugh ...	2013-04-14
This vapid, vulgar insult to the intelligence couldn't possibly have been tested on any focus groups. Can we all now agree that we've reached the cinematic saturation point with the rapidly-expiring, Scary Movie franchise?	2013-04-14
If I ever have to watch another Scary Movie film, I'll give up on writing, cinema, and society forever.	2013-04-13
For the art-house crowd, who may, I suppose, stumble drunk into the wrong theater after too much Chardonnay, there are nods to Black Swan and 127 Hours.	2013-04-13
The scariest thing about Scary Movie 5 is that it actually made me chortle less than some of the silly horror flicks it's trying to spoof!	2013-04-12
Lacking a single honest laugh, this is shoddy by comparison with the other Scary Movie sequels... which throws it in a pit with Transylmania, Breaking Wind and Stan Helsing.	2013-04-12
A film composed almost entirely of jokes that were much funnier when you read them on Twitter years ago.	2013-04-12
Like so much of this whole series, the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious.	2013-04-12
Scary Movie 5 must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab, rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office.	2013-04-12
If it's even possible, Scary Movie 5 is worse than its predecessors, reaching all new heights of stupidity and fall-flat comedy.	2013-04-12
The best part of Scary Movie 5 -- not counting the part when it's over -- comes near the beginning.	2013-04-12
I have been to funerals a LOT less sad than this laughless 85 minutes. (Complete Content Details for Parents also available)	2013-04-12
Scary Movie 5 is a dumbed down and hollow version of the franchise formula - resulting in an idiotic (and unamusing) attempt at parody that is tedious not fun.	2013-04-12
A hate crime against cinema, a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator.	2013-04-12
yap yap yap yap yap...	2013-04-12
The "Scary Movie" franchise has never been known for its highbrow comedy, but this latest installment feels especially juvenile and pointless.	2013-04-12
There are opportunities to have a good time with this film, if you are a forgiving sort.	2013-04-12
This is the sort of movie where you feel bad for Sheen and Lohan, because they hadn't actually hit rock bottom until they agreed to appear in it.	2013-04-12
You know that friend of yours, the one who can't tell even the simplest joke? Watching him struggle for 85 minutes would still be funnier than this movie.	2013-04-12
Even if you chuckle occasionally at this, it's hard to see how anyone would want to pay to see it.	2013-04-12
Another pointless exercise that only served to make me deeply examine why comedy was ever funny. Next time, I'd rather just laugh.	2013-04-12
Surely we have a responsibility to audiences in need of laughter, and surely we can do better than this.	2013-04-12
The inexcusably desperate "Scary Movie 5" is this once-prosperous series' death rattle.	2013-04-12
85 or so minutes of random nonsense from filmmakers so clearly dispirited by their mercenary assignment that they seem to be running out the clock from the very first frame.	2013-04-12
[A] numbingly inane if cheerfully up-to-the-minute new entry in a franchise presumed to have breathed its last seven years ago.	2013-04-12
You must have a better way to spend that $13.	2013-04-12
Put it this way, there's a spoof of "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" in which gorillas throw their feces at the wall to see if it sticks, and you can't help wondering if this is actual documentary footage of the script meetings.	2013-04-12
A pitiful grab bag of awful with a torturous sense of humor, crash landing a formerly inoffensive franchise into hostile Friedberg/Seltzer territory.	2013-04-12
If AIRPLANE! was Mad Magazine at its absolute best, a real genius work of insanity, SCARY MOVIE V is an issue you don't bother trying to get back after the teacher confiscates it.	2013-04-12
Scary Movie 5 is so bad, it makes A Haunted House look like a Seltzer/Friedberg comedy.	2013-04-12
like a sharp stick in the eye	2013-04-12
Spoofing movies ranging from Black Swan to Mama to Paranormal Activity, this installment of the profitable series is woefully, painfully unfunny.	2013-04-12
Spoofs always break the rule of half-mocking something stale, but I had no idea we needed a minimum amount of time needed before a reference.	2013-04-12
These movies grow shorter and less funny by the year.	2013-04-12
When you find yourself wishing there was more Lindsay Lohan in a movie, you know it's bad. SCARY MOVIE 5 is so bad that a DJ spinning a pizza instead of a record is what passes for a sight gag. Or a woman having sex with a microwave...	2013-04-12
This is the first Scary Movie in seven years, but the formula remains unchanged, with a thin storyline linking spoofs of Hollywood hits.	2013-04-11
It says a lot about the film that the only half-laughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan.	2013-04-09
Gary Oldman's gor-blimey Cockney accent and Harrison Ford's scarily short buzz cut are the most striking features of this disappointingly routine corporate espionage thriller.	2014-03-08
With a strong cast and striking production values, this thriller is sleek enough to hold our interest even if corporate espionage isn't a very exciting topic for the movies.	2014-03-07
Offers nothing by way of suspense, intrigue, or characters who rise even a little bit above the yawningly bland.	2014-03-06
No-one brings anything close to their A-game in this chronically ham-fisted corporate sabotage thriller.	2014-03-06
Even a cast boasting Oldman and Harrison Ford can't salvage his dreary, contrived corporate thriller.	2014-03-03
passable as a piece of disposable movie star pulp	2013-12-06
"Paranoia" is not nearly as bad as you may have heard, but it does have a few too many narrative issues holding it back.	2013-11-19
So cliched and tiresome, it could be a minor work of cinemasochistic genius. Also, Harrison Ford appears to be possessed by a necromancer.	2013-10-15
This is a tedious turkey of the first order. As well as being supremely dull, the film does no favours for feminism - or what's left of it - as far as film roles go.	2013-09-29
Excruciating dialogue is only the tip of the iceberg of this film's dunderheadedness, but it's the sin that keeps on giving throughout the way too many 108 painful minutes it takes to get through it.	2013-09-07
Would have been fine as a simple, slickly-produced TV movie, but with Ford and Oldman in the cast it can't be considered anything but a big-screen letdown.	2013-09-06
Answers the question nobody was asking: what if the director of Legally Blonde remade The Conversation?	2013-09-05
Aussie director Robert Luketic's clever fingerprints are all over the film, with its dictating pace, well maintained tension - but above all, his flair for casti	2013-09-05
A proficient thriller but there is little individuality: it feels as though we have seen this all before	2013-09-05
Forgettable and generic...	2013-09-01
This boardroom blackmail romp feels as contrived and silly as anything Luketic has helmed in recent years.	2013-09-01
If there's anything most conspicuously in short supply in this thriller it's a strong sense of exactly that, paranoia.	2013-08-31
...the denouement...has no relationship with what has gone before. Junkie XL's music builds tension and, believe me, this movie needs it because the story is so weak.	2013-08-30
In a movie about a new generation's hunger to topple the old guard, pretty boy Hemsworth is outclassed by his veteran costars, who get more mileage from baring their teeth than he does baring his chest.	2013-08-29
How did they take Joseph Finder's good novel and make a lackluster film with a super cast? Go figure!	2013-08-28
a flabby congealed thing that is in no way helped by lackluster direction and a derivative script	2013-08-23
Bolstered by a bland by a lead performance by Liam Hemsworth, Paranoia gives no reason for audiences to look over their shoulder, but plenty of them to keep an eye on their watches.	2013-08-23
The inert techno-thriller Paranoia is much like watching an app download on a weak Internet connection -- slow and tedious, it seems to take forever.	2013-08-23
A better title might have been Greed, Theft or Espionage. Or, to be brutally honest, Boredom.	2013-08-22
Less actively bad than utterly, painfully familiar, the kind of movie that stakes its claims entirely on opening-weekend box-office receipts because those involved know nobody will remember it come Monday.	2013-08-21
The movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense and, when it does, it would be better off not doing so.	2013-08-18
Not an original bone in its body -- but there's always something to be said for a great cast.	2013-08-17
Paranoia is so ineptly made that the ride home from the theater will be more suspenseful than anything that took place on the screen.	2013-08-17
So dumbed-down that it's totally lacking in suspense and common sense.	2013-08-17
Another late summer loser.	2013-08-17
A tepid would-be corporate thriller with a young lead not ready for prime time, and even old hands like Ford and Oldman can't save it.	2013-08-16
Fixates on the perils and panic of our modern surveillance culture while itself proving to be borderline unwatchable.	2013-08-16
You watch it and, despite all the au courant techno geekery on display, you feel like you've stepped into a time capsule. It's a nice feeling at first. If only the movie were better.	2013-08-16
You're not paranoid -- it really is bad.	2013-08-16
"Paranoia" is too sloppy and slack to inspire tension.	2013-08-16
The plot isn't just routine but also totally nonsensical and illogical. No amount of "suspension of disbelief" can save this movie.	2013-08-16
Paranoia? More like deja vu.	2013-08-16
While Paranoia has been cast with some top-notch actors, the problem here is a lack of oomph both in the script, adapted from Joseph Finder's novel, and the pretty lame direction by Robert Luketic.	2013-08-16
Director Robert Luketic's thriller Paranoia has a host of problems, but the biggest seems to be that no one in it is nearly paranoid enough.	2013-08-16
Slick but muddled thriller about corporate espionage never gets our pulse pounding.	2013-08-16
Paranoia never quite manages to thrill in its attempt to portray corporate America as a sea that's swimming with unseen perils.	2013-08-16
There's much sprinting and keyboard-clacking for an audience that might feasibly value the sight of either over the presence of genuine invention or suspense.	2013-08-16
The film is all thunderous cliches.	2013-08-16
It's more like "Parannoying."	2013-08-16
"Paranoia" should be commended for attempting to give younger audiences something more mature to digest at the movies, but unfortunately once the film hits a dead zone, the reception is lost for good.	2013-08-16
When you can see every twist coming, the turns aren't exciting.	2013-08-16
Only twice, when Ford and Oldman snarl at each other from leather sofas, does "Paranoia" show signs of life.	2013-08-16
These characters keep the WOPR on their iPhones, and the further Luketic pushes the fantasy of wireless spy games, the deeper Paranoia digs itself into a hole of improbability.	2013-08-16
It's like one of those cheap knockoff phones you might buy on a streetcorner in Manhattan -- the "IPhoen 5&#8243; of thrillers.	2013-08-16
PARANOIA probably would have gone straight to DVD were it not for Ford ad Oldman's contributions. It's a relentlessly boring thriller with an incredibly bland performance by star Hemsworth.	2013-08-16
Even when a dance movie is following the formula as closely as Battle of the Year does, occasionally something you won't get to see anywhere else slips through.	2014-02-14
Josh Holloway tries his hardest, God bless him, but Battle of the Year 3D can't even be enjoyed as a blissfully dumb entry in its genre.	2014-02-06
I didn't think it was possible, but "Battle of the Year" is more pandering than the entire "Step Up" series combined...	2013-12-12
Dismal, cliche-ridden stuff.	2013-11-11
What could've been a fun '80s throwback ends up more frustrating that it's worth.	2013-11-11
Battle of the Year would rather use crowd-shot cutaways to convince you of the dancers' prowess than focusing on the stage.	2013-10-10
Like those it imitates, the film includes some energetic dance sequences and formulaic plotting that culminate in the obligatory final competition.	2013-09-30
If director Werner Herzog can do it with 'Rescue Dawn' and 'Little Dieter Needs to Fly,' why can't director Benson Lee?	2013-09-28
In particular, as mentioned, the dance sequences are a mess, which is the kiss of death for a film in this genre.	2013-09-27
Battle of the Year is no Step Up 3D. But then, what is?	2013-09-27
Filled with fancy, if frenetic footwork but weighed down by all-too-familiar plot/characters/dialogue.	2013-09-26
Athletic dancing and a patriotic theme make this movie better than it should be.	2013-09-25
Introduce female choreographer. Explore misogyny for 15 seconds. Become uncomfortable with ideas. Disappear female choreographer.	2013-09-24
After months of patient waiting, 2013 has finally produced a movie that's so bad it's good.	2013-09-23
Everything else in this pedestrian dance drama is either absurdly corny or just plain moronic, though the feature does win points for being so earnest with its hopeless pile of cliches.	2013-09-23
its dramatization of a U.S. dream team's journey to the international showcase is leaden with predictable character types and storytelling cliches, neither of which its well-executed but oddly infrequent dance sequences are able to overcome.	2013-09-23
Eschewing shaded characterization and often basic sense, while establishing what should be the high-water mark for most crotch-grabbing in a single film in 2013.	2013-09-21
There's not nearly enough quality material to make Battle of the Year recommendable to anyone other than the most hard-core of dance fanatics.	2013-09-20
The bar for urban-flavoured dance movies has already been set pretty low, but Battle Of The Year effortlessly leans back and limbos on below it.	2013-09-20
The actual dancing scenes are occasionally electrifying, if far too sparse, but other than that and the welcome sight of co-star Chris Brown getting clocked in the face, the film barely gets off the ground, much less sticks the landing.	2013-09-20
Passable drama has great dancers but no originality.	2013-09-20
A dead-in-the-soul cash grab of a movie set in the competitive world of B-boy dancing that thinks cliches, phony melodrama and product placement can substitute for real storytelling and actual characters.	2013-09-20
Battle of the Year clearly features lots of brilliant dancers, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy watching them move. But you wish there were more dancing here.	2013-09-20
Should satisfy the planet of b-boys and girls to whom it thoroughly preaches, while amusing anyone else who simply can't ignore the promise of an all-corn buffet.	2013-09-20
The movie's inability to showcase its greatest asset, the grace and control of its dancers, is its most conspicuous failing.	2013-09-20
The 3-D is a pain, and the excitable editing, slo-mo and speeded-up action frustrate attempts to watch the athleticism on display ...	2013-09-20
This screenplay makes the "Step Up" dance films come off like Shakespeare in comparison. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2013-09-20
A film steeped in the streetwise hip-hop culture should have an edge, but Battle of the Year is safer and softer than Drake's last album.	2013-09-19
The miracle of the new 3-D dance film "Battle of the Year" is how it can be so relentlessly boring while there is so much frenetic activity on screen.	2013-09-19
The raison d'etre of popping-and-locking scenes is trumped by tired team-building bathos, whose flagrancy is anything but conducive to spreading the film's hug-it-out bro-love.	2013-09-19
The story is a derivative quilt, patching together cliches from every sports movie since 1976.	2013-09-19
This 3-D spectacle is less the dance movie that's going to make b-boying cool again than a shill for sponsors' gear.	2013-09-19
At the risk of sounding 100, I think it's regrettable this film had to be shot in digital 3-D.	2013-09-19
A frenetic mess that makes Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloolook like a Fellini film.	2013-09-19
Battle of the Year is too inept to make this tired premise sing.	2013-09-19
If you can get past the mountain of cliches and poor acting and hackneyed story lines and the fact that someone let Chris Brown be in a movie, "Battle of the Year" is actually ... still pretty awful.	2013-09-19
Fatally frontloaded with endless training montages, awfully written, indifferently acted drama, sports-film platitudes and jaw-dropping product placements that only the hardiest of viewers will make it through to the payoff.	2013-09-19
Bland and boring are not the adjectives you hope for from a movie starring Josh Holloway as an alcoholic coaching a team of young breakdancers to the world championship (in 3D!).	2013-09-19
Chris Brown gets punched in the face, so it's not a total wash.	2013-09-19
so familiar that you half expect Julia Stiles and Channing Tatum to show up and start hoofing	2013-09-19
Everything about Benson Lee's predictable dance flick "Battle of the Year" strikes me as old.	2013-09-19
Destined to please only bad movie buffs desperate for a fix of awful dialogue, blatant product placement, and clunky exposition.	2013-09-19
It isn't good by any stretch of the imagination, but B-movie lovers who like their dance movies flashy, fun, and spectacularly dumb shouldn't mind.	2013-09-19
Battle of the Year crams so many cliches into its 109 minutes that you just know it will end with a sports movie freeze-frame. And it does!	2013-09-19
It's undeniable that the good-natured "Afterschool Special" vibe here plays to the film's corny strengths, and the dancing is impressive. So much so that it's almost impossible not to cheer during the final round.	2013-09-19
Not badly executed, but not the least bit original either.	2013-09-19
The dorky, jingoistic charm wins points just for daring to dress the team in red, white and blue Kangols while the judges scream, "Korea strikes back with an aerial assault!"	2013-09-18
Remarkably, the highlight of Benson Lee's film, essentially a fiction reboot of his Planet B-Boy, isn't the scene where Chris Brown gets punched in the face.	2013-09-18
Some scripts can be saved by a good cast that delivers the material with as much chutzpah as possible. And then there are some that are simply unsalvageably dreadful.	2014-02-20
Nao e apenas uma ma comedia; e mau Cinema.	2013-09-01
The goofy characters waltz through plenty of offbeat situations, but that's not enough because quirky and funny are not synonymous.	2013-08-13
What it desperately needed was more originality. I suppose Zackham thought that if he just got a great cast and sprinkled enough humor into it, then those would be enough to cover up all the flaws in the script. Unfortunately, he was very much mistaken.	2013-08-12
Behold the unholy matrimony of hack-job romance and whack-job comedy. Witness the blindingly bleached marriage of house-porn and cocky Caucasian privilege. Suffer the union of former A-list stars and express-cashed paycheques.	2013-07-11
Built on chaotically disparate tones and extremely broad jokes that never hit their mark, The Big Wedding is completely devoid of laughs.	2013-06-05
Sinks to new levels of horrid.	2013-06-03
At least somebody does fall in the swimming pool. It's Robert De Niro. Unfortunately, he resurfaces.	2013-06-02
With De Niro inexcusably using what is for many people the single most obscene swear word, this is well off target.	2013-05-31
An all-star cast very nearly goes down with the ship as filmmaker Justin Zackham (The Bucket List) indulges in relentlessly farcical silliness.	2013-05-31
Big wedding? Big fat nothing, more like.	2013-05-31
"Oh God, this is humiliating," trills Diane Keaton and she never said a truer word.	2013-05-31
This is not so much Meet The Fockers as meet the shockers. The jokes are something old, nothing new, mainly borrowed and sadly blue. De Niro is a shadow of his former shelf, not so much Taxi Driver as taxidermy.	2013-05-30
Disappointing, poorly conceived comedy that's both emotionally unconvincing and depressingly low on laughs, though the performances ensure that it remains watchable.	2013-05-29
Pure claw-your-eyes-out cinema.	2013-05-29
This is one of those farces you come away from thinking the French would have done better. Then you discover that the French have already done it, and better.	2013-05-29
It's not the sheer predictability of the ensuing frolics that's hardest to take, or even the dismal attempts at humour ... but the sheer misery of watching actors you once respected demean themselves in such utterly worthless fodder.	2013-05-29
A frothy and harmless confection that squanders the on-screen talent.	2013-05-29
You'll run out of appendages on which to count the cliches.	2013-05-29
While it's nice to see talents like Keaton and Sarandon in The Big Wedding, it's ultimately frustrating seeing their talents wasted in Zackham's paper-thin excuse for a rom-com.	2013-05-29
We don't.	2013-05-27
The jokes are squeezed from the ragged plot with the grace of an arthritic senior citizen trying to get milk out of a coconut by hand.	2013-05-27
One can only assume there was a big fat paycheck involved for the likes of Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon and Diane Keaton to negotiate a script with such lack of ambition, laughs and insight.	2013-05-27
Involves four Academy Award winners, all cruelly wasted on roles unworthy of them.	2013-05-23
Weddings can often be occasions of trauma, as well as joy, and so it proves with this ensemble comedy. Well - minus the joy, that is.	2013-05-23
The film is only endurable to those who can blank out the memory of what [De Niro] did when he was young and what he once meant to us.	2013-05-23
The beigest film ever made.	2013-05-23
Absolutely every character ends the movie on an upbeat note, proving that weddings are the best situations for solving peoples' problems.	2013-05-23
Wedding isn't telling a story so much as selling a lifestyle - one that, rather like Heigl's morning sickness, makes you want to vomit.	2013-05-15
As bland as a box of beige rocks.	2013-05-05
It's not a bad film by any means, and there is some fizz seeing Sarandon, Keaton and De Niro bounce off each other, verbally and physically. Yet the film seems stuck in first gear, seemingly reluctant to dial up its screwball potential.	2013-05-04
Barring a few off-color jokes, though, the movie feels like a Carol Burnett sketch dragged out to feature length.	2013-05-03
"Big" is an awfully ambitious modifier to affix to this pale wisp of a film.	2013-05-03
All of the actors, young and old alike, look plastic, and the characters' big revelations -- pregnant, lesbian, had an affair, etc. -- all feel plastic.	2013-05-03
Vulgar, witless, and an insult to its stars and its audience.	2013-05-02
It simply takes all the things you've seen in other wedding movies and recycles them, all while pretending you're dumb enough not to notice.	2013-05-01
The Big Wedding is not a classic, or even really memorable, by any means, but considering the pit it starts at, it gets off light. And that's better than usual.	2013-05-01
Can I just say that The Big Wedding smells from herring and be done with it?	2013-04-30
It's tired and dated with too few laughs to justify the stultifying attempts at drama and the impossible-to-swallow plot contortions.	2013-04-28
For a movie ultimately about what freaks we all are behind the fronts we build for the sake of normalcy, the apathetically performed The Big Wedding couldn't possibly be more square.	2013-04-27
Ten minutes into this one and I was all set to hack off my arm "127 Hours"-style in order to escape and I wasn't even pinned underneath anything but a mounting sense of dread.	2013-04-27
An incoherent string of crude skits, including one where Robert De Niro sheepishly sports a substance-eating grin after being caught performing cunnilingus between a widespread pair of naked legs. Look! A falling star! Make a wish!	2013-04-27
Katherine Heigl puked on Robert De Niro, and he still had a better time than I did at The Big Wedding.	2013-04-26
Looks great, some terrific ingredients, but when you slice it up, what a disappointment.	2013-04-26
I'm... pleased?... not sure if that's the right word... surprised or relieved, maybe, like finding out you get to be the front part of the human centipede... to report that this not-very-good wedding farce is also not the worst film of all time.	2013-04-26
It's a movie packed with purportedly smart characters making the sort of absurdly contrived decisions that haven't been seen since "Three's Company" went off the air.	2013-04-26
What was once an amusing French farce has become a crass, crude, mean-spirited, smarmy mess.	2013-04-26
Sarandon, Keaton and De Niro mesh beautifully, fully convincing as a trio of old friends and carting in lots of characterization that would be otherwise lacking in Zackham's rote screenplay.	2013-04-26
Their idea of a minority is, in all seriousness, a British dude painted orange.	2013-04-26
When Robert DeNiro says things like "poon job," it hurts our ears and probably leaves a bad taste in his mouth.	2013-04-26
"Grown Ups 2" takes its rightful place in the pantheon of terrible films, becoming just another one to avoid like your life depended on it.	2013-11-04
Grown Ups 2 is the culmination and epitome of laziness not just for Sandler, his friends, or director Dennis Dugan, but comedy as a genre.	2013-10-30
The leads dampen the delivery with a noticeable lack of energy. It's telling when the most charismatic comedic performance comes from Taylor Lautner...	2013-10-03
Adam Sandler's follow-up to one of the most improbable blockbuster comedy hits in film history - Grown Ups took $270m in 2010 - is a similarly plotless, reasonably pleasant, rough-edged comic ramble.	2013-09-29
This is not a movie. This is nothing but Adam Sandler hanging out with his pals and congratulating himself on how awesome he finds himself to be.	2013-08-25
There was nothing remotely notable about 2010's Grown Ups, and now we have a sequel that's even lazier.	2013-08-12
Somehow, the word 'sequel' doesn't fit: it would be like describing three months of agonising spinal surgery as the sequel to falling off a cliff.	2013-08-10
As disposable and forgettable as its 2010 predecessor...	2013-08-10
It's easy to be critical of films which have no aim other than to entertain, but if you're half way to Sandler's juvenile, rather sexist mentality you will find more comedy highlights than you'll be expecting.	2013-08-09
No human being possesses the imaginative power to sufficiently lower his or her expectations to anticipate the sheer laziness of this putrid ensemble comedy.	2013-08-09
Unsuitable for all ages.	2013-08-05
This Happy Madison remedial-school version of 'This Is 40' is as insane and dumbfounding and worthy of WTF mock-cult status as 'The Room' or 'Manos, Hands of Fate,' even if it did earn $42 million its first weekend.	2013-08-01
The simplest way to put it is that if you liked the first Grown Ups, you will also like this one: it's an equally shameless, just-as shoddy, no-less depressing sprawl of 'life lessons' and fat gags.	2013-07-30
The script feels aimless and desperate, even by its own aggressively sophomoric standards.	2013-07-22
Sandler and his pals are in the enviable position of having the muscle to do their thing for fun and profit.	2013-07-22
The Land of Lazy can crown a new king because with Grown Ups 2 Adam Sandler has officially nabbed the throne.	2013-07-19
Adam Sandler has made some warm and funny movies but this one is a mess from start to finish.	2013-07-18
It's plotless, pointless, soulless, but worse than all of those things.... it's just NOT FUNNY!!!	2013-07-17
Full of coarse excuses for humor and cruelty, 'Grown Ups 2' literally spews bile at its audience.	2013-07-15
Clearly this is the film to see if you have a long standing grievance about the way deer have been mistreated by humans and long to see them take their revenge.	2013-07-14
one long, smug, self-satisfied smirk at the audience	2013-07-13
Just when it seemed like it couldn't get any worse for Adam Sandler, Grown Ups 2 underperforms its predecessor in every way imaginable.	2013-07-13
Sandler could very well have scribbled the script on the back of the cheque he and his co-writers were given in advance to produce a sequel, any sequel - just a movie with the number two in it - which happens to be the number of times you will laugh.	2013-07-13
There are NOT enough adjectives in the English language to describe this vile, disgusting excuse for a movie. If I can stop even one person from paying to see this crap, then I have done my job!	2013-07-13
"Grown Ups 2"... will be hard to top as worst film of 2013, and is an instant contender for most worthless movie of the decade.	2013-07-13
Sandler and his writing partners jump from one crude gag to the next without a trace of a plot or narrative sense. This would be OK if any of the jokes were remotely funny, but they're mostly retreads of the bad jokes from the first movie.	2013-07-13
Spoiler alert: the very last joke of Grown Ups 2 involves a character passing gas on Salma Hayek...This sequel is even more plot-less, even more conflict-less, even more, more, more, of less, less, less.	2013-07-12
It's Rob Schneider who had something better to do!!!! I have to refer to him forever from this day forward as The Smart One.	2013-07-12
Judging from the box-office success of 2010's Grown Ups, there is a healthy-sized audience for this brand of comedy.	2013-07-12
...offensive, crude, vulgar, and appeals to the lowest level of taste and refinement, replete with disgusting puerile urination and scatalogical gags...	2013-07-12
The only way this could be worse is if it were a sequel to Jack & Jill.	2013-07-12
For a film about facing irrelevance, Grown Ups 2 isn't fighting for a place in the race.	2013-07-12
It's almost funny that Sandler's films about being older are his most immature, as if in an attempt to make a movie about recapturing youth, he's showing us exactly why you shouldn't.	2013-07-12
Some of the gags are childish but really, isn't that why you go to a movie like this in the first place? I know that's why I do.	2013-07-12
A mix of cheap sentiment and fart jokes.	2013-07-12
There can be no justification for the laziness and indifference of the makers of this, because I cannot understand how any audience, much less themselves, can tolerate the incompetent, sub-moronic spectacle that resulted from that lack of effort.	2013-07-12
Grown Ups 2 delivers exactly what it's been advertising in trailers and on talk shows: grubby low-comic escapism.	2013-07-12
This is pap, plain and simple: scattered raunch-lite devoid of emotional resonance.	2013-07-12
It makes the first movie look like The Maltese Falcon.	2013-07-12
A movie of fools, by fools, for fools.	2013-07-12
"Hey, remember 20 minutes ago when we were at K-Mart and all that stuff we saw and did there?"	2013-07-12
If nothing else, the movie's themes are announced: domesticity, ogling, excrement.	2013-07-12
At some point, someone in a position of authority will tell Adam Sandler no, or at least ask to read a screenplay.	2013-07-12
The best thing I can say about Grown Ups 2 is that Rob Schneider is not in it.	2013-07-12
Is there any good that could come of raging against the emerging of the burp-sneeze-fart?	2013-07-12
Friendship, family and breasts: Sometimes that's all you need.	2013-07-12
This is how the audience is repaid, offered bathroom humor bookends as reward. It might be hard to believe, but the sequel actually gets worse as it drags its corpse-like sense of humor around for what feels like an eternity.	2013-07-11
Crude, sophomoric sequel doesn't improve on original.	2013-07-11
The film, at its core, is about being bullied & standing up to bullies and claiming one's community. Some nice sentiments, but so much of it is lost amidst the rampant, third-grade level stabs at humor.(Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2013-07-11
Every iota of logic, common decency and college educated critical self within me all but screamed that this film is an insult to my intelligence and an affront to the entire human race and I'd listen if I wasn't so busy laughing.	2013-07-11
Those who found Twilight nauseating will find The Host has the same overlong runtime, cornball characters, and artificially pumped up romantic stakes.	2013-10-09
The Host fails as a romance, but it also struggles as an adventure film. The body-snatching angle has been done before, and the aliens... aren't menacing enough.	2013-07-16
Oh, the silly movies we must endure. "The Host" is perhaps one of the most brain-dead sci-fi love stories to come along in many years.	2013-07-10
What sort of worked on the page crashes and burns on the screen, as even an actress of Ronan's caliber can't make these self-debates anything but ridiculous.	2013-05-22
It's all very confusing, and not very interesting.	2013-05-13
Beyond Meyer's trite-and-untrue formula (supernatural love triangle, exotic locale, family values and kisses as daring and transgressive), corpse-stiff dialogue, flat action sequences and a confused allegory make this movie particularly stultifying piffle	2013-05-06
You might despise the 'Twilight' series and still find something to appreciate here...at least it's original.	2013-04-25
Catnip for the cooing teen female set but far less engaging and rewarding for anyone else.	2013-04-23
And you thought Twilight was bad...	2013-04-14
This limply directed, solidly boring slice of sci-fi twaddle features humanoid aliens who spend much of their screen time staring blankly into the middle distance with glazed eyes. About 10 minutes into this dross, you'll know what that feels like.	2013-04-12
Just like her Twilight series, Stephenie Meyer's 2008 novel The Host becomes another feature in which people are standing around and brooding ( ... ) Proof that it's not easy to make thoughts seem riveting when little is happening.	2013-04-12
Niccol crafts some arresting imagery, though the slow pacing and droning new age score makes everything feel like an endless Ambien commercial.	2013-04-12
Resistance is futile.	2013-04-11
It's a reasonably intriguing premise, but the alien invasion soon takes a back seat to the kind of tiresome teen angst where crucial plot points hinge on a kiss.	2013-04-10
So badly scripted, performed and directed that it literally destroyed my faith in humanity.	2013-04-08
Three bodies plus four minds is some fertile arithmetic, but The Host can't be bothered with the intellectual or kinky ramifications of its setup.	2013-04-05
There's much grave talk of souls in this sci-fi romance. Ironic, then, that it ends up being such a soulless and trifling affair.	2013-04-05
It's bewildering how sci-fi aficionado Andrew Niccol ("Gattaca," "The Truman Show") could mastermind such a parasitic mess.	2013-04-05
Yeah...um...no...don't ever do this again please.	2013-04-04
Come back Bella and Edward - all is forgiven.	2013-04-04
Saoirse Ronan is a talented young actress but the silly dialogue and convoluted plot make this movie average in so many ways.	2013-04-04
Stephenie Meyer has found a whole new way for teen girls to be conflicted about sex...	2013-04-04
This is not the first time that Meyer's muddled prose has dragged an interesting director to his artistic doom.	2013-04-04
This is a flaccid affair ...	2013-04-04
Compounding the dismal storytelling is Niccol's general disregard for narrative structure and pacing.	2013-04-03
The central premise of The Host is fundamentally unfilmable and, hence, probably shouldn't have been filmed.	2013-04-03
Teen sitcom-level dialogue, wooden acting, snogging-in-the-rain flashbacks and ludicrously chrome-plated alien racecars.	2013-04-03
There's a compelling idea in here somewhere, one that sadly gets bogged down in Stephenie Meyer's ongoing desire to focus intently on all the least interesting things in her own stories.	2013-04-02
The only reason I had any hope was the presence of Saoirse Ronan in the leading role...	2013-04-02
The Host doesn't strive for social allegory, as previous body snatcher flicks did... it's merely a teenage girl's fantasy checklist for prom: Which "me" should I be, which guy should I go with, and can we get one of those shiny sports cars to drive?	2013-04-02
Even by the standard of paranormal teen romances, The Host is ridiculous stuff, and derivative too.	2013-04-01
The nagging disembodied voice of Melanie comes across like the Great Gazoo to Wanda's Fred Flintstone ("Don't steal my boyfriend, dum-dum!")	2013-04-01
Space-Ronan kisses a boy and her inner human screams "NO!," slaps the confused male, then runs off to brood by a rock, staring into space. It will make sense to some of you.	2013-04-01
The story concept is interesting, but it gradually runs off the rails and doesn't end up being as good a story as it should have been.	2013-03-31
2013's The Host is eye gouging, can't-get-the-hours-back-of-your-life kind of bad that if there's any justice will quickly disappear from your local screen, soon to be forgotten save for those masochistic few who actually stomach the entire running time.	2013-03-30
The Host just isn't a very good movie.	2013-03-30
Midway through The Host I started longing for the depth and sophistication of any random Twilight movie.	2013-03-29
plays out like something an eleven-year-old girl would write on the back of her notebook while she was bored in class... with the emotional depth of a wet napkin	2013-03-29
... edgy on the surface but a cheesy love story at its core, complete with longing glances and music swells.	2013-03-29
Almost everything said by Melanie sounds childish and outrageous. It makes The Host extremely immature.	2013-03-29
The Host lacks quality acting and any hint of a decent story. The result is a sci-fi film with no science and a romantic film with no romance. In other words, it's the dullest 2 hours imaginable.	2013-03-29
This is pretty silly stuff, Twi-lite if you will, but played with maximum solemnity, no discernible humor and minimal excitement.	2013-03-29
[A] bizarre Saturday Night Live sketch about a girl with a bratty alien inside her.	2013-03-29
The Host is a passable film that could entertain a slim segment of viewers that were turned-off by Twilight - while fully catering to the Twihard crowd.	2013-03-29
Invasion &#8232;of the &#8232;time-wasters: 'Host' alienates audience	2013-03-29
Skipping merrily over plot holes in search of the next Romantic Teen Moment, The Host inadvertently raises the question: If this is the way the world ends, is it worth trying to save it?	2013-03-29
Yes. It all feels weird and just a little awkward, but thanks to Ronan and the endless layers of well-intentioned meaning, The Host finds enough schmaltzy charm to bid its guests adieu without embarrassment.	2013-03-29
A ponderous and at times pretty silly romantic sci-fi adventure.	2013-03-29
The Host isn't very good as a romance. There's not very much passion on screen, which makes the film a poor cousin to Twilight.	2013-03-29
The movie's structure is awkward. There's no real narrative thrust.	2013-03-29
Plays like it was written and directed by people who have never listened to or heard of punk rock in their lives	2013-12-17
Under Rickman's pained gaze you wonder what he saw in the music, although when you hear it... it does take you back. There's something there, but CBGB isn't it.	2013-12-12
It's '24 Hour Party People' without the wit and definitely without the love of the music it pretends to lionize.	2013-11-14
Ultimately, CBGB tries to be too cute of a film about a great, gritty topic, but for those seeking an innocent trip through a pivotal time in rock, it's better than a kick in the head.	2013-11-08
By no stretch of the imagination is CBGB a well-made movie. [But] since the lightweight plot and great music make this less annoying than Rock of Ages, fans of the era may find something to enjoy.	2013-10-24
The film has energy to spare, but the comic-book visual style is heavy-handed and the film merely skims the surface of the club's influence on the pop-culture landscape.	2013-10-18
A rushed, chaotic and almost incoherent recap of the backstory behind the Lower East Side's iconic (and now defunct) punk music club.	2013-10-18
The magnitude of what went on at 315 Bowery is largely missing, though it's hard not to be at least a little bit stirred by the covers.	2013-10-18
The music rocks, but little else does, in Randall Miller's sitcom snapshot of New York's iconic punk incubator.	2013-10-15
Warm gloss of nostalgia over the rise of the punk music scene in gritty 1970's downtown New York. The spirit of musical and visual energy outweighs fanciful superficiality.	2013-10-13
It takes a lot of effort to take the underdog stomping grounds of New York's top punk acts and turn them into the Central Perk from Friends-albeit with slightly more stain-but CBGB does it with total conviction.	2013-10-11
'CBGB' is something those clamoring, three-chord amateurs rarely were: harmless.	2013-10-11
a moderately effective overview of the club's early years, distilled into sitcom-worthy vignettes without the kind of recklessness to make them seem truly dangerous, CBGB is the pop-punk version of a raucous, punk-rock story.	2013-10-11
Alan Rickman's lead performance highlights a sincere but insubstantial rock pic.	2013-10-11
These are icons, not accessories in some Hot Topic cover version of "Teenage Lobotomy."	2013-10-11
"CBGB" ain't no party, it ain't no disco, it ain't no foolin' around.	2013-10-11
CBGB generally feels like a misstep, with self-aware characters all stuck in a movie that can't decide what it wants to be stylistically.	2013-10-11
If you really want to remember those times? Get out "Horses." Or "Talking Heads: 77." Or "Blank Generation." Preferably on vinyl, with all the pops and scratches. And play them. Loud.	2013-10-11
I fail to grasp the point of making this movie.	2013-10-11
I would swear on a stack of Dead Boys T-shirts and a first pressing of Richard Hell and the Voidoids' "Blank Generation" that it could not possibly have been like that: so silly, so trivial, so boring.	2013-10-10
In place of punk's howling rage, you get gross-out jokes that include at least a half-dozen close-ups of the poop from Kristal's bowel-challenged dog.	2013-10-10
This is not a film for purists or quibblers.	2013-10-10
Whatever may be there, Miller doesn't quite capture it.	2013-10-10
The movie feels like a Las Vegas imitation of a place that was once scuzzily, beautifully alive.	2013-10-10
Unenlightening and overworked, the effort turns the raw energy of a movement into a Saturday morning cartoon, counting on a soundtrack of classics to carry the viewing experience.	2013-10-10
No doubt a decent movie could have been made about the behind-the-scenes life of CBGB, but CBGB isn't it.	2013-10-10
I'm here to tell you why I enjoyed CBGB despite its terribleness. Or rather, because of its terribleness.	2013-10-10
Punk may not be dead, but this picture is D.O.A.	2013-10-10
The absolute antithesis to the pioneering punk spirit it tries to portray.	2013-10-09
Yet another film from Miller, starring Rickman, with an engaging protagonist and an interesting backdrop or pitch, but little sense of psychological depth.	2013-10-08
Mythologizing by way of whip-pans and slapstick spit-takes, CBGB just might be the CBGB that we deserve.	2013-10-08
As the film moves from one musical performance to another, the result increasingly feels like a series of celebrity impersonations set to a best-of-punk compilation album.	2013-10-08
CBGB misses the opportunity to educate. But its biggest sin, unlike many who performed there, is that it also misses the opportunity to entertain.	2013-10-07
CBGB is like a cheap cover band - sure, you'll get some entertainment, but the experience is missing that original spark of life.	2013-10-07
[VIDEO ESSAY] If you're a punk fan then you're - at best - on the dark side of your '40s. Nonetheless, you will be drawn to see "CBGB" for yourself regardless of how disappointed you will be.	2013-10-03
There's very little rockin' goin' on at the CBGB, and those unfamiliar with it will wonder what the fuss is all about.	2013-09-12
Neither worthy of my laughter nor capable of inducing sleep. No, this is one of those rare films where its badness turns the cogs of your brain.	2014-02-06
A Haunted House is technically inept, monotonous, and stiflingly cheap-looking. How this cost $2.5 million dollars to produce is beyond me.	2013-11-25
Too banal to be offensive, it's certainly one to miss	2013-10-18
Frustratingly, there's actually talent on-screen that hints at what could have been a cleverly comical take on the found-footage genre.	2013-06-27
Heck, worse films starring Robert De Niro have been released this year.	2013-06-21
Yet another spoof from Wayans and Alvarez, this movie isn't nearly as bad as it could have been (they also produced the resolutely unfunny Scary Movie 2 and Dance Flick).	2013-06-21
There's just an odd recurrence of homophobic humor in the entire movie that compensates for lack of actual humor.	2013-06-20
This send up of the Paranormal Activity films provides a few laughs here and there, but for the most part its crude and cliched script is ridiculously stupid, embarrassingly over the top and occasionally offensive.	2013-06-19
This Haunted House needs a KEEP OUT sign nailed to the door.	2013-06-18
Just another in a long line of mercilessly unfunny spoofs.	2013-06-17
Clearly what the world needs right now is another low-rent horror movie spoof. And this one's not bad. Sticking to Paranormal Activity for its premise, it actually produces some pretty funny moments.	2013-06-02
A painfully unfunny, overly familiar send-up of recent horror franchises.	2013-06-02
Sporadically misogynistic, homophobic and grade-school puerile in equal measure, it is also not without the occasional laugh-out-loud moment.	2013-05-30
The moments where you feel the cast are off-script and riffing are fun if not actually funny, but the most horrific thing on offer here is misogyny.	2013-05-29
Dreadful.	2013-05-27
Somewhere between a spoof on Paranormal Activity and crazy fun, film gathers pace and comedic momentum as it goes. The cumulative effect, especially if enjoyed in a group of relaxed friends, is likely to be hilarity ... black dude jive kinda hilarity	2013-05-27
This is the first film I've seen that depicts rape perpetrated by a bisexual, weed-smoking ghost, and probably the last.	2013-05-22
Truly one of the worst horror spoofs of all time, and there have been some hideous failures over the years. Poorly written, repetitive and offensive on every level without being funny. Wait, I'm just getting started.	2013-04-17
I thought coming down with the flu would be the worst thing to happen to me this week. But that was a few days ago when I was still sweating it out in bed and coughing up my lungs... before my immune system was further compromised by A Haunted House.	2013-03-11
You know a fright-flick craze is in danger of running its course when Marlon Wayans comes along to broadly, belatedly spoof it.	2013-01-25
Along comes Marlon Wayans to do in A Haunted House what he once did in Scary Movie. And do it much, much worse.	2013-01-25
A Haunted House is just what you'd expect of a spoof aimed squarely at adolescent males.	2013-01-25
A movie that offends every moral sensibility but delivers few comedic rewards.	2013-01-24
Gross, annoying, boring, stupid and above all not funny!	2013-01-24
It's like watching a snuff film, only it's the audience who's dying inside.	2013-01-18
Does it even qualify as a movie? Why did it take two people to write and cost $2.5 million to make?	2013-01-15
Marlon Wayans takes comedic aim at Paranormal Activity and its ilk but scores precious few hits.	2013-01-15
The concept relies too heavily on crude gags that feel more desperate than inspired.	2013-01-14
You might chuckle at Wayans huddled in the tub, frantically trying to scrub himself clean of something slightly more earthly-freaky than evil spirits. But watching him get it on with stuffed animals? Ick.	2013-01-13
There are vague hints that the story is "really" about the difficulties and anxiety of commitment, but then one of many variations on a fart joke distracts from any actual idea.	2013-01-13
Mining the spoof genre he helped reenergize with the "Scary Movie" franchise, Marlon Wayans comes up short with a well-worn scattershot approach that rarely connects with audience funny bones.	2013-01-13
There's no reason to reward or encourage any of the people involved with A Haunted House to continue making this type of off-putting (and disposable) raunch-fest.	2013-01-11
This found-footage spoof impresses right out of the gate, because in the first five minutes one sacred movie taboo is thrown out the window and pummeled to absolutely absurd lengths.	2013-01-11
If the opening gag in your R-rated movie is an extended flatulence joke you should reconsider whether you're qualified to make such a movie.	2013-01-11
Who thinks it's high time for a movie that spoofs The Blair Witch Project? Hands! Anyone? Anyone? No?	2013-01-11
If you're wondering why A Haunted House exists alongside the upcoming Scary Movie 5 rather than instead of it, you may already have given the subject more thought than Marlon Wayans had hoped.	2013-01-11
exactly what you'd expect from a spoof of found footage movies released in January without advanced screenings for critics	2013-01-11
Harkens back to the initial days of the oughties spoof craze, when screenwriters actually lampooned film genres rather than whatever the hell happened to catch their eye on YouTube as they sought inspiration.	2013-01-11
Disrespect is the name of the game for this flat, by-the-numbers Paranormal Activity spoof, which suggests that letting your girlfriend move in with you is pretty much tantamount to opening the gates of hell.	2013-01-11
The craftsmanship here isn't just lacking, it's nonexistent, and the found-footage conceit is little more than a rickety structure to house an endless gauntlet of hackneyed jokes involving sex, flatulence, pot, and feces.	2013-01-11
Nobody expects A Haunted House to be a masterpiece, but in going for the easy joke, the film missed out on many opportunities for satire.	2013-01-11
A frenetic and freewheeling satirical comedy that only sporadically scores a bull's-eye while aiming at easy targets.	2013-01-11
This parody of Paranormal Activity and other found-footage horror films too often substitutes raunch for wit.	2013-01-11
As to be expected with a Wayans endeavor, the picture is crude, desperate, and permissive with its actors. What's surprising here is how lazy A Haunted House is.	2013-01-11
"Paranormal Black-tivity?" Played.	2013-01-11
Doesn't so much skewer the popular Paranormal franchise as clone it into a comedy in which farting and the word 'asstraphobic' pass as jokes.	2013-01-11
It's bad, but at least it's beguilingly bad.	2013-01-11
"A Haunted House" runs a scant 86 minutes, but it's a painful 86 minutes, seeming twice as long and more punishing by the second.	2013-01-10
The homophobia that saturates [this film] is no mere joking around. It comes from a place of hate and [the filmmakers] must be held accountable.	2013-01-10
Mean-spirited, badly made and unfunny is one set of disasters; adding in storytelling incompetence adds to the catastrophe.	2013-01-09
...the movie's relentlessly frenetic vibe grows more and more exhausting as time progresses...	2014-04-23
In what is sure to turn out to be this generation's Toy Story, this crazy-funny animated lark takes us into a hyper-happy world where everything is so awesome there's even a pop anthem called Everything is Awesome... fresh and fast and funny.	2014-04-11
... let's not pave all the roads with yellow bricks just yet.	2014-04-10
Delightful, inspired, affecting, utterly hilarious stuff, and certainly the first feature starring Batman to earn a couple of those compliments.	2014-04-09
Just as the conceptual agility of The LEGO Movie never ceases to astonish - it will take at least three viewings to fully take in every last detail applied here - the visuals both innovate and resonate to heights only previously scaled by Pixar.	2014-04-09
it's worth your time to discover instead of me preempting by synopsis and/or recitation. I hate it when an internet post ends this way, but it's all you're going to get from this review: "Enjoy!"	2014-04-08
A wry, playful and intelligent piece of filmmaking that, like Toy Story before it, rises far above its station.	2014-04-06
The Lego Movie is woeful, forgettable and one of the great film disappointments of this decade.	2014-04-05
The Lego Movie is a brilliant technical achievement.	2014-04-04
It's fast, smart, really funny, full of great action and contains a song, 'Everything is Awesome', with the single catchiest hook in the history of songwriting. Seriously, in this movie at least, everything really is awesome.	2014-04-04
This is one of the most creative animated features in recent years. I never imagined that so much could be made from the concept.	2014-04-04
The giggle-inducing gags will infect humans of any age with their zany sense of humour.	2014-04-03
It's relieving to say that it brims with visual charm and creativity.	2014-04-02
State-of-the-art software has been used to make the characters look like actual plastic figurines brought to life through the magic of stop-motion animation. In other words, this is a digital movie with an analogue soul.	2014-04-02
With all this going for the film, you can understand why Lego should be so pleased with it and why it's already had such world box-office success. But its relentless action and pounding soundtrack sent me out feeling battered rather than uplifted.	2014-04-02
At its core, The Lego Movie is an ode to imagination, creativity and busting outside the status quo, so it's wholly fitting that the film itself - from its storytelling through to its superb animation - embodies these qualities beautifully.	2014-03-30
Teaming with life, the lifeless, virtually immovable figurines come alive and appear to move with all the dynamics of people, albeit smaller and cuter.	2014-03-29
A healthy dose of off-the-wall humour as the action speed-skates into overdrive, challenging and surprising us constantly as ideas veer left of centre	2014-03-29
Moving at the speed of the imagination it's a hyperactive adventure that breathlessly moves from crazy to bonkers.	2014-03-26
The richness of animated detail is more compelling than any substantive narrative insight.	2014-03-24
You may not find yourself goofily grinning and laughing at any other film this year as you will during this and that's fitting because they just don't build too many movies like this anymore.	2014-03-24
While the Lego toys might be simple and plain, the film version is most definitely not.	2014-03-21
It is as original as cartoons come.	2014-03-10
A story about creativity, independence and cooperation running on a crazy rail of pop-cultural riffs and satirical references, understated comedic nuance and explosively absurd visual magic.	2014-03-10
As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception.	2014-03-03
A thrilling, consistently funny, all-ages extravaganza, The Lego Movie is virtually critic proof, in that we can't find a darned thing wrong with it.	2014-02-28
A spiritually literate animated film for people of all ages that affirms that everyone is special and everything is truly awesome.	2014-02-24
On the basis of their three feature films, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are masters of transforming unlikely source material into something wonderful.	2014-02-24
This endlessly inventive toy-inspired comedy is brilliantly designed and animated, even if it goes on a little too long and gets a bit treacly toward the end.	2014-02-22
Pleasantly bonkers.	2014-02-21
Smart and hilarious, with writing as brilliant as the colors of Lego blocks, 'The Lego Movie' is wowing winter-worn audiences of all ages.	2014-02-21
a hectic bum-rush of clever pop-culture and corporate satire that works just well enough to help us forget that it is essentially a 100-minute commercial	2014-02-19
One can imagine that this story is a reflection of the same kind of struggle that happened during the making of this movie between the corporate suits of Lego, who exercised some control over the film, and the creative people who made the movie.	2014-02-18
A tribute to Lego made by enthusiasts, not an ad for Lego made by hacks.	2014-02-18
Beguilingly bonkers... a comedy adventure that bowls along with the freewheeling inventiveness and surreal leaps of a child's imagination.	2014-02-18
I am afraid that for me this film was not quite awesome.	2014-02-17
A true masterpiece of a film from the animation to the storyline behind the Lego universe.	2014-02-17
Lord and Miller have found the mythological resonances that, along with handy licensing agreements, link those plastic bricks to the past three decades of pop culture.	2014-02-16
While younger viewers will delight at the whiz-bang animation action and hugely likable familiar figures, adults will laugh themselves silly at the smart consumer satire gags and goggle in wonder at the undulating Legoland vistas.	2014-02-16
With a 100-minute run time, The LEGO Movie often does feel like too much of a good thing; I was satiated more than once. But it would be curmudgeonly not to enjoy many of the gags that the film has to offer.	2014-02-14
It's about as magical and wondrous a movie as I've seen with more laughs per minute than any movie in recent memory. The LEGO Movie is an absolute delight.	2014-02-14
Adults who go to The Lego Movie out of a weary sense of parental duty are in for a very pleasant surprise.	2014-02-14
The Lego Movie's desire to inveigh against social conformity turns into a plea for collectivism. It's a message that will inevitably send the blood pressures of FOX News pundits through the roof.	2014-02-14
A film every bit as imaginative, colourful and cleverly constructed as their plastic inspiration.	2014-02-14
Though not everything about The Lego Movie is awesome, you'll leave the cinema wearing a real smile.	2014-02-14
Funny, inventive and bound to boost sales of the interlocking plastic bricklets even further.	2014-02-14
If it sounds like a glorified toy commercial, well, there's no denying it is. But it's an advert packed with invention, humour and charm - the kind you'd skip through TV programmes to watch.	2014-02-14
This film contains the best Batman theme song...ever.	2014-02-13
A work of unbridled imagination, apt to delight sociologists, stoners and six-year-olds alike.	2014-02-13
It's playtime on film, done with wit, warmth, and respect for the business of imagination.	2014-02-13
Anderson and his crew build an impeccable, elaborate world that is opulent and breathtaking, yet somewhat silly.	2014-05-29
The movie may suffer from some of its quick-and-done plotting, but its quality of humor, spectacle, and acting is all top notch.	2014-05-23
Anderson's film looks good enough to eat; swallowing it is another matter.	2014-05-21
This wacky screwball comedy, loosely based on stories by Stefan Zweig, has a plot so labyrinthine and frantic it is hardly worth following, except for the fantastic sets and appealing central characters played by Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori.	2014-05-08
An argument could be made that this is Wes Anderson's best film.	2014-05-01
Anderson's sights are like scenes from a storybook, and the actors move and speak with a clockwork cadence that adds to the sense of comedic orchestration.	2014-04-29
Watching Wes Anderson quietly and unsentimentally make Zero the hero of The Grand Budapest Hotel should win over some of the director's detractors.	2014-04-28
It is a film that maintains its illusion with grace-and ruefully unmasks that illusion every bit as gracefully.	2014-04-28
Fans of director Wes Anderson, here's what you've been waiting for since you saw 'Moonrise Kingdom.' 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is another comedy with quirky characters and oddball encounters.	2014-04-24
A typically witless comedy from Wes Anderson that has about as much to do with Stefan Zweig as it does with WWII and Nazism, the disasters that led to Zweig's suicide in 1942. A total travesty.	2014-04-21
Runs in the vein of Anderson's more exotic pictures (think 'The Life Aquatic' and 'The Darjeeling Limited').	2014-04-21
Any single frame qualifies for wall space in a cinematic museum as the players ingeniously apply their emotive elasticity to fit the Anderson universe.	2014-04-15
Eloquent, offbeat and charming, The Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson's most accomplished film to date.	2014-04-13
Fiennes is magnificent, his droll wit and a "keep calm and carry on" delivery occasionally peppered with highlights of profanity and fire. Comedic timing perfection.	2014-04-12
Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel is a work of visceral, madcap comedic genius.	2014-04-11
Another visually scrumptious cinematic doily from America's master of over-designed whimsy, Wes Anderson, and this one is measurably better than many of his previous efforts in that there's something resembling a plot at the heart of it.	2014-04-11
Filled with fully fleshed out characters, amazing dialogue and a look that is right out of the 1940s, the film travels smoothly on the shoulders of Ralph Fiennes.	2014-04-11
A fairytale for adults, this is Anderson's uber-film thus far, utilising the entire breadth and astonishing depth of his imagination to bear exquisite humour and life in every single, immaculately composed shot.	2014-04-11
Anderson's focus on oddball humor, audaciously eloquent dialogue, and cartoonish absurdity remains central and doesn't get derailed by the overly forced attempts at familial pathos that have marred some of his other films	2014-04-11
swallowed whole by the grey beast solipsism.	2014-04-10
It's satisfying to see this level of craftsmanship applied to a film that is often so silly it's a pure delight to watch.	2014-04-10
This is full of the elements you expect to find in a Wes Anderson film. There are lovingly composed tableaus - each a marvel of production design - immaculately designed uniforms for both soldiers and hotel bellboys and a sighting of Bill Murray.	2014-04-09
This is about as fun as movie-going gets. Fans of Anderson's work should love it; those who've disliked the artifice and nostalgia of his earlier films will find those elements put to more entertaining use here.	2014-04-09
Anderson is at the middle of point of his life, considering the uncertainty of the world.	2014-04-08
Often lazily and unfairly accused of crafting works that trump style over substance, Anderson's painstaking attention to detail here beautifully serves the story.	2014-04-07
It's an eloquent, observant and mature comedy about the decay of an era.	2014-04-07
The Grand Budapest Hotel is as inventive and immaculately orchestrated a cinematic universe as I've ever seen.	2014-04-06
It is beautifully designed, visually ravishing and symmetrical to the nth degree. And it is full of frantic chaos, with a Lord of Misrule at its centre played with effortless comic brilliance by Ralph Fiennes.	2014-04-04
The success of Anderson's admirable ambition is to have elevated anachronism, pastiche, personal passions and larger cultural memory to a heady froth, but one that also knows the butt-end of a rifle.	2014-04-04
The result is a deliciously rich and, dare I say, old-fashioned entertainment, filled with affectionate jokes and cinematic references.	2014-04-04
In addition to being a character-driven caper, beautifully designed, it's also an excellent tribute to the act of yearning for a better world.	2014-04-04
The Grand Budapest Hotel is another feather in the cap of this wonderful director. It's quaint, charming and poignant.	2014-04-04
Every single frame ... is mesmerising, fascinating, surprising, fabulous, a stunning construct of colours and textures, the surreal and the visceral	2014-04-04
Brilliantly conceived and executed ... dry, droll and delightful. It's a treasure trove of wonders - visually and emotionally - with its stylised, colourful production design	2014-04-04
With his latest, the time has arrived to stop thinking of Anderson's movies as great to look at and start thinking of them simply as great.	2014-04-02
Farcical pleasures are plentiful in Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, set in an eastern European republic steeped in Marxism. Groucho, not Karl.	2014-04-01
Funny, if not gut-busting, and well-executed, if not a masterpiece.	2014-03-31
The film that Wes Anderson was born for.	2014-03-31
Anderson's script is sharp and funny, and never bashful about pausing the laughs for such melancholic reflections, mostly to grieve the loss of a time and place, and occasionally the people.	2014-03-28
Anderson serves his guests meticulously assembled fun in "The Grand Budapest Hotel."	2014-03-28
A stylistic and thematic progression, it's Anderson's most complex, nuanced effort, and his bawdiest, perhaps funniest, screenplay yet. It may be his masterpiece.	2014-03-28
Can you make a successful comedy entirely out of eccentric, marginally related episodes? The Grand Budapest Hotel proves it's possible, if you're Wes Anderson.	2014-03-27
Dreams die gentle deaths as characters adjust and adapt, and try to find humanity in a world in which the problems of a few little people don't amount to a hill of beans - except to them, and their world is our world.	2014-03-27
Wes Anderson's delightfully original, bittersweet, slyly campy saga of murder, theft and conspiracy that becomes a whimsical, madcap romp.	2014-03-27
A sublime whodunit designed for cinephiles with sophisticated palates.	2014-03-24
Like the tool-stuffed pastries baked by the film's winsome young Agatha, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an irresistible frosted confection with a steely, purposeful center.	2014-03-24
Just like its namesake, there is something outrageously regal about the movie 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' that makes it a warm and exciting place to check into.	2014-03-24
The best film of Wes Anderson's career.	2014-03-23
Like Gene Hackman in The Royal Tenenbaums, Fiennes seems both in sync and immune to Anderson's fastidious nature. It's a tour-de-force performance that should earn an Oscar nomination but will most likely be overlooked in favor of more sober portrayals.	2014-03-23
The movie is a flume ride through the imagination of one of the most creative minds making movies today, and the pleasure curls your toes. Also, be ready to crave some macaroons.	2014-03-22
Rithy Panh turns a potential gimmick into a profound, inspiring film. Then, in expanding his scope to the propaganda machine of that regime, he reaches straight into the heart of evil and finds cinema.	2014-06-05
Cambodia's first-ever nominee for best foreign-language film is part-documentary, part-memoir, and impossible to forget or ignore.	2014-05-29
In narration that is poetic and historically astute, Panh layers his own memoir atop his nation's.	2014-04-24
Dioramas of Cambodia's Killing Fields	2014-04-18
Though difficult at times to watch, it bears potent and personal witness to an era that, like all such tragedies, should never be forgotten.	2014-04-16
Rithy Panh's cinema is an exemplary case of the imperative to bear witness.	2014-04-15
A juxtaposition of horror and beauty that's a must-see.	2014-04-04
A melancholy tone poem, a remembrance of what Cambodia lost.	2014-04-04
Many films have examined from many vantages the Khmer Rouge's nightmare reign, notably Roland Joffe's 1985 Oscar winner The Killing Fields.	2014-04-04
Devastating.	2014-04-03
As haunting as it is haunted, "The Missing Picture" leaves viewers' heads rattling with ghosts.	2014-04-03
A uniquely subjective account of the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s, "The Missing Picture" is the work of Rithy Panh, a Cambodian native who left his homeland when he was an adolescent.	2014-04-03
[It] aspires to a poetry about barbarism that will not let us forget.	2014-04-03
Creatively relives Cambodian holocaust and surmounts the storytelling problem intrinsic to retelling horrors. . . in 1st-person narration with unusual visual illustration.	2014-04-01
Rithy Panh tells his story with the events recreated, with his many clay figures and settings, from his memories of the atrocities as a boy.	2014-03-30
In Panh's deft hands, the film becomes not just a recreation of a reality long gone, but an indication of ever-present melancholia for an entire people.	2014-03-22
The result is a stunning mediation on loss and memory, with no shortage of anger to boost the narrative.	2014-03-21
What remains disturbing and puzzling is the realisation that somewhere along the line the real and the false change places, and that Panh is able to move us more deeply with his dioramas than by telling the same atrocious story in a straightforward way.	2014-03-21
The film captures how Pol Pot took Mao's Great Leap Forward to new levels of Marxist madness.	2014-03-21
Panh uses the props and eerie clips from Khmer Rouge propaganda newsreels to tell about his family, and his country. Along with starkly poetic narration, read by Randal Douc, the effect is devastating, without a single scene of actual bloodshed.	2014-03-20
These miniatures magnify their subjects, and ennoble them. The picture is anguishing to see, but it isn't missing anymore.	2014-03-20
Panh believes that those who survive such oppression are obligated to speak about it - and this chronicle is impossible not to watch.	2014-03-20
A survivor's story,a political statement and an eloquent meditation on images and memory. The miniatures and the film are exquisite works of art infused with living memory	2014-03-20
This is a first-person account of astonishing suffering, yet the experience of watching "The Missing Picture" is not punishing.	2014-03-20
Panh blends documentary, personal memoir and eccentric artistic experiment ...	2014-03-20
It joins films like 'The Act of Killing' and 'Manakamana,' which find ingenious ways to get around both a lack of traditional documentary material and certain tropes (talking heads, dry exposition) that have soured into unimaginative cliches.	2014-03-19
[The Missing Picture] carries with it such a burden of personal and collective pain, and bears reliable witness to such a huge historical crime, that I'm almost ashamed to add that it's inventive, imaginative, beautiful and at times even charming.	2014-03-19
As an examination of memory and experience and how they shape us, "The Missing Picture" is meaningful beyond its specific subject matter.	2014-03-19
The audacity of "The Missing Picture" - a brilliant documentary about a child who held on to life in Cambodia's killing fields - is equaled only by its soulfulness.	2014-03-19
A haunting and personal work of beauty and a testament to one man's refusal to accept oblivion.	2014-03-18
Writer-director-coeditor Rithy Panh's 'The Missing Picturs/L'image manquante' is unusual in its documentary recreation method and, beyond the medium of film, in its theme.	2014-03-18
Obviously based on Panh's autobiography, this is a reminder of obliteration and how cinema can claim memory, history.	2014-03-18
The Missing Picture is so immediate, so vital, it practically breathes. Not all memoirs need to exist. But the gentle urgency of Panh's story is right there in the filmmaking.	2014-03-18
The conceit is tremendously daring, but one with a huge payoff, suggesting an evil that can't be fully processed by young eyes.	2014-03-18
The Missing Picture isn't a straightforward piece of storytelling, but more of a meditation on what happened [...] whenever the narration threatens to drift off into the ether, the figurines and models ultimately keep it on terra firma.	2014-03-18
With their elemental poses, the rough clay figurines serve as abstractions for the Khmer Rouge victims...they show what archival footage cannot- senseless violence and death in a world without any form of culture, in which normality has been upended.	2014-03-18
Panh honors the Khmer Rouge's victims while staging the agony and responsibility of memory itself.	2014-03-17
Little clay figures, mouths agape, arms raised, crying in pain, dying of starvation ... each little figure drawing us in with their silence and their stillness like great actors	2014-03-16
The Missing Picture invites uncomfortable reflections. Modest in scale, simple in conception, it is a great film - certainly a great little film - and many viewers will be moved to tears.	2014-03-14
With sober eloquence, the filmmaker lays out the arrival of the Khmer Rouge, the philosophy used to justify their crimes, and the slow slipping away of his family, each member claimed by this horrible social experiment.	2014-03-13
A blend of documentary and memoir that's like a dream and a nightmare, though it's more commendable than actually engaging.	2014-03-02
Panh's film uses the most plastic, fictive of forms to disinter well-buried historical truths.	2014-02-28
It is ingenious, poignant and resonant, if lacking in narrative momentum.	2014-02-10
A historia e antiga: mudam os opressores; os oprimidos, porem, sao sempre os mesmos.	2014-02-06
Mainly, though, what the film elicits is horror, all the more pointed for existing in the juxtaposition of these childlike representations and the actual events they stand for.	2014-02-01
Panh's remarkable new documentary works as a survivor's testament, a film about memory and loss -- and as a self-reflexive essay asking how atrocities should be depicted on screen.	2014-01-16
The task of chronicling the unimaginable is handled with great care in The Missing Picture, an affecting documentary about the brutality of Cambodian strongman Pol Pot's reign.	2014-01-16
The tale, which would be unwatchable in unexpurgated reality, is told instead with carved clay figurines, doll's house-sized stage sets and archive footage of Pol Pot's bloody and brutal takeover in 1975.	2014-01-16
The result is at once limited and brutally effective in communicating the emotional stasis of memory and the dehumanisation that comes from the ruthless enforcement of pure ideology.	2014-01-16
With his poignant, insightful narration read in French by Randal Douc, Panh tells of his vibrant life before 1975 and increasingly grim existence after that.	2014-01-16
The effects are as incredible as you might expect, and the cast delivers that mix of superhero and tongue in cheek that works so well for a modern audience.	2014-06-05
In addition to technical proficiency, it remains closer to its own logic than many a big studio sequel, and it benefits from that clarity.	2014-06-05
It lives. It breathes. It has a sense of humor. It is very probably the best comic book movie since Singer gave us X2: X-Men United back in 2003.	2014-06-05
Previous X-Men films have gone overboard with the number of characters but X-Men: Days Of Future Past has found the right balance.	2014-06-05
The cast is the best imaginable for this sort of thing.	2014-06-04
the story's stakes are, despite the familiarly bleak post-apocalyptic setting, inherently more personal and intimate, which makes the film as a whole more emotionally gripping	2014-06-02
A perfectly fine reboot for a series in dire need of one, as well as a very good and exciting X-Men film all around.	2014-06-02
"X-Men: Days Of Future Past" is vibrant and entertaining.	2014-06-02
The most astoundingly okay movie so far this year - which is apparently all it takes to earn high praise these days.	2014-05-31
It's more like a Roger Moore James Bond movie, maybe even Moonraker but I say that as a Bond fan who appreciates the blatant outrageousness of Moonraker. If Moonraker sounds like an insult, then Days of Future Past is at least Octopussy.	2014-05-30
Those with wistful memories of the 1970s will find plenty to like in X-Men: Days of Future Past.	2014-05-30
That Singer fellow sure can make an X-Men movie.	2014-05-29
Much of this takes place in the early 1970s, which gives the filmmakers an excuse to haul out lots of vintage kitsch and make some rather tasteless references to the Vietnam war.	2014-05-29
Wonder of wonders, it has what too many blockbusters lack: villains with motivations beyond "world domination."	2014-05-29
Continuing to be the most original and resonant of the Marvel superhero franchises, the X-men return in the capable hands of director Bryan Singer, who again stirs plenty of meaty subtext beneath the thrilling action.	2014-05-29
...an erratic yet rewarding entry within this ongoing series.	2014-05-29
Dark, enthralling and undeniably exhilarating, this is the X-Men movie for X-Men aficionados.	2014-05-28
There is never a dull moment here as we watch on, uninterrupted, with constant interest in an ambitious display of paradoxes and riddles.	2014-05-28
The results are both dazzling and intimate, clever and - during one tour-de-force sequence - spectacularly funny.	2014-05-28
Does a fine job of portraying the broad-strokes emotional storytelling that popcorn movies are best at... very fun and very operatic, large and imposing and dazzling.	2014-05-27
...funny, sharp, and breathlessly paced, and is one of the few films this year that are worth the exuberant price of a current 3D ticket. Bring on X-men: Apocalypse.	2014-05-27
It's significantly better than most of the previous "X-Men" outings.	2014-05-27
At least we can have moments like "Days of Future Past" where the crew that started it all can pop in and remind us of how it is supposed to be done.	2014-05-27
X-ceptional movie fun.	2014-05-27
On the whole, this film is well-acted and there is plenty of action. The plot could have been better, but most of the plot problems are not large ones. The special effects are very good, and the film looks good in 3D.	2014-05-26
X-Men, a fabled franchise that, like a fine wine, just keeps improving with age.	2014-05-26
Wolverine gets lots of camera time, visual effects look stunning, the time-travel theme is intriguing -- though sometimes confusing - and HOPE emerges as the film's appealing message.	2014-05-25
While entertaining and bolstered by excellent pan-X-Universe performances, Days of Future Past is a grimmer, less exhilarating chapter in the saga.	2014-05-25
Hits that sweet spot of being really exciting and just substantive enough to earn our engagement. In the comic book-movie realm, it sits comfortably in the upper echelon.	2014-05-25
X-Men: Days of Future Past is full of sound and fury signifying box office.	2014-05-25
A rollicking, if sometimes convoluted, good time, featuring a high-toned cast and a seriousness of purpose that sets it apart from the candy-colored Marvel-produced films and Sony's underwhelming Amazing Spider-Man series.	2014-05-25
More of the same, only bigger, louder and messier as the pretty-good sequel to the very-good 2011 prequel pushes the "franchise extender" mentality currently consuming Hollywood to new extremes.	2014-05-24
There's quite a bit to like about Days of Future Past, but it feels more like a step backward than the creative leap forward that Matthew Vaughn's prequel pointed towards.	2014-05-24
Singer's reprise is too busy to make sense...two and a half cheers.	2014-05-24
Blockbuster films so often blow so much of their budget on special effects but think of the plot as an afterthought. This one dares to reverse that mistake by investing heavily in its writing and allowing CGI to perfectly complement it.	2014-05-24
It's that kind of movie: knowledgeable, emotional, and packed with incident and excitement.	2014-05-24
In the glut of superhero films flooding theaters these days, the X-Men series stands above the rest.	2014-05-24
It's more enjoyable than the other blockbuster action super-hero films that have been released so far this summer.	2014-05-24
Captures the true essence of what has made and will make the X-Men's uncanny popularity survive and thrive in days of future and past.	2014-05-23
This is Mystique's movie. The filmmakers are obviously making the most of Jennifer Lawrence's current star power by putting her right out front for this one.	2014-05-23
A jumble of mutant melodrama that's pleasing but never wholly poignant.	2014-05-23
one of the best X-Men movies ever made	2014-05-23
Amazing what substance in performance can do to distract from the incredible and incredibly silly.	2014-05-23
How do you screw up a movie starring James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult and Peter Dinklage, to name a few? I'll give you a hint --- the script!	2014-05-23
I would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film.	2014-05-23
The novelty has worn off...but I think its greatest appeal will certainly be to devotees of the genre.	2014-05-23
There's no zip, no driving force, no personality to these movies, other than what the overqualified actors manage to squeeze out of their individual scenes.	2014-05-23
X-Men earns another shot at being a seminal comic-book franchise.	2014-05-23
X-Men: Days of Future Past succeeds at being a thrilling and fun superhero movie, balanced by well-earned dramatic weight.	2014-05-23
Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this picture's new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards' limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink.	2014-05-23
Much better than the first in the series. In fact, it was better as action and better as social commentary. If like me you go with few expectations, you will be delighted.	2014-05-23
"'The Winter Soldier' not only satisfies with its plentiful action scenes, it also offers some intriguing commentary on the current political and world climate, and turns out to be a sterling character piece."	2014-05-09
...has a nice push and pull going on, between nostalgia for a time gone by and a piercing, contemporary relevance.	2014-05-01
I salute you, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.'	2014-04-24
It's a sequel with great substance and one of the finest action movies of the years.	2014-04-22
A substantial disappointment after 2011's better-than-expected Captain America: The First Avenger...	2014-04-22
'Winter Soldier' is a layered and paranoid espionage thriller, what you'd get if John le Carre took a stab at the superhero genre.	2014-04-21
A solid example of meat-and-potatoes popcorn filmmaking--befitting that most meat-and-potatoes of comic book heroes.	2014-04-19
If only the film's level of visual creativity could have been applied to the story, it might feel like a standalone success instead of merely another link in the chain.	2014-04-18
Gives an adult tilt to the Marvel Comics world	2014-04-18
Proving his mettle in a story with a darker tone, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent chapter in the Marvel canon.	2014-04-18
The Winter Soldier delivers a funnier, angst-ridden Captain for our security vs. liberty-obsessed times.	2014-04-16
the movie stabs right at the heart of the ultimate virtue for which Captain America stands--freedom--by questioning what exactly such a virtue entails and what is required to preserve it	2014-04-14
May be the most thoughtful instance of character depth in a comic-born action extravaganza.	2014-04-14
I'm afraid of Robert Redford.	2014-04-13
On a fundamental level, the Russos get the character of Captain America, and this deep understanding trickles down into the film in satisfying ways.	2014-04-12
The movie doesn't use any time in establishing an identity, because it is obsessed with the thrill.	2014-04-11
Yet another super-sized serving of superhero cinematic sponge cake... this follow-up really feels like bloated franchise filler.	2014-04-11
A great addition to the Marvel heroes family, (this) is another testament to the powers that be at Marvel Studios know that anything worth doing is worth doing well!	2014-04-11
Chris Evans has grown significantly in his role since The Avengers, and he's far more appealing here, going for the same kind of charming, simple quality that Christopher Reeve had in the Superman movies.	2014-04-11
It's politically contentious, if not downright rambunctious. Movies like "The Parallax View" aren't being made today, yet Disney-Marvel puts it out there, blunt as ice, the state of privacy politics today.	2014-04-11
It's hard to tell the difference between the parody and the parodied in Marvel movies; almost everything comes with a wink until Things Get Serious at the apocalyptic climax.	2014-04-11
The unlikely directors are comedy connoisseurs Anthony and Joe Russo, working with a gargantuan Marvel/Disney support team no doubt organized on the theory that these movies have become Too Big To Fail...	2014-04-11
Most fascinating is watching the cast's two old pros, Jackson and Redford, spark in surprising ways.	2014-04-11
[There's] a great film that could have been made by the same people and much of the same raw material, but commercial forces obliged it to instead be just pretty good.	2014-04-11
Black Widow is the scene stealer this time out... There's just very little than can be said against a film this well-rounded and complete... Trust no one - except Marvel.	2014-04-10
For what it's worth, I'm looking forward to its sequel.	2014-04-10
Follows the all-too-familiar mantra of blockbuster sequels - more of everything is better-but it can't be accused of lackluster filmmaking.	2014-04-10
Yes, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a great action movie -- an immensely enjoyable spy-thriller-flavored film with Bond-worthy flair (and orchestral flourishes). But first and foremost, it's also a great Captain America film.	2014-04-10
Acaba se perdendo na necessidade de incluir elaboradas sequencias de acao e de ser um "filme de super-heroi" em vez de insistir na ideia de ser um filme sobre um humano que tem superpoderes.	2014-04-10
A solid piece of blockbuster filmmaking. Would have LOVED it if I didn't walk in feeling like I've already seen it.	2014-04-10
A mission quite accomplished for those hooked on all things Marvel.	2014-04-09
What a ride. It is a real popcorn movie.	2014-04-09
The best thing in the film is, in fact, its take on Captain America that makes it great, as Evans plays Cap as Jimmy Stewart on steroids...	2014-04-09
It's one hell of a proper action thriller. A full-speed man-on-the-run story with layers of intrigue and violent stakes.	2014-04-08
Miles beyond the great 2011 chapter. Ups the ante in storyline, character development and action, while giving a thrilling setup for future installments. It's the best of the Marvel/Avengers pantheon since The Avengers movie.	2014-04-08
Super Fun, Super Exciting,	2014-04-07
The Russos raise the stakes on each successive action sequence, until they arrive at [a] thundering, brutal, intensely suspenseful climax.	2014-04-07
The film's blend of top-notch action, well-timed humor, engaging leads and cleverly resonant plot makes it a superior all-around movie than the nonsensical rollercoaster ride that was The Avengers.	2014-04-07
A brawny blockbuster-formula movie with the brains of an espionage thriller, it recalls vintage '70s spy romps but resonates with contemporary issues.	2014-04-07
If the original is anything to applaud, the sequel usually isn't. And even more rarely is the sequel actually better. But with this near-perfect comeback, we don't see so much of it coming, we enjoy nearly all of it and we can't ask for very much more.	2014-04-06
There is something for everyone in this big, sprawling adventure film with political commentaries and absurd conspiracies, but there is a lot less comedy than there was in 'Thor: The Dark World,' for instance.	2014-04-06
A spy-centric, timely, intriguing thriller.	2014-04-06
Trust, betrayal and good ole-fashioned right and wrong lie at the heart of Marvel's latest offering.	2014-04-06
Comic book superheroes never seem to go out of fashion, even the spandex-clad, mild-mannered, good character, patriot, old-fashioned kind like Captain America.	2014-04-06
Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a mesmerizing superhero film that satisfies on every level. When that last snake head is chopped off, you still find yourself wanting more after 136-minutes of pure comic book superhero cinematic nirvana.	2014-04-05
Despite all its flaws, 'The Winter Soldier' is never less than marginally watchable, even occasionally exciting. But you crave a more vibrant sense of humor.	2014-04-05
"Captain America" is a grittier, more dangerous and darker movie than you've come to expect from the features in the Marvel franchise.	2014-04-05
After not helming big-screen offerings for almost nine years (not since "You, Me and Dupree"), Cleveland-reared directors Anthony and Joe Russo throw in a few inspired winks to some stimulating movies from the more politically influenced past.	2014-04-05
It imports so many cast members from The Avengers that it almost feels like the Age of Ultron is already upon us. Yet it's a credit to the scripters that their stage feels crowded but not cluttered, as every character is allowed opportunities to shine.	2014-04-05
A career centerpiece, a significant artistic contribution in its own right.	2014-06-05
"Elaine Stritch" is filled with bluster and memories, blunt outbursts and funny moments. But more importantly, it is filled with honesty.	2014-04-04
The fledgling filmmaker finds what feels like just the right ratio of glitz to guts. One comes away with the sense that Stritch wants more than anything for the show to go on, while knowing better than anyone that her final bow can't be far off.	2014-03-26
Stritch is a force of nature	2014-03-23
There's an impressive candor and depth to this documentary about the life and career of Stritch.	2014-03-21
This admiring but forthright portrait does justice to Stritch's engaging, no-nonsense personality.	2014-03-19
Broadway stage musical veteran Stritch is an acquired taste.	2014-03-14
It is in this moment that 'Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me' becomes not only a guidebook on how to age gracefully and boldly but a perfect illustration on what drives performers to perform.	2014-03-14
Broadway legend Elaine Stritch is the subject of the documentary "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me" and, quite a bit of the time, she also tries to direct it.	2014-03-14
Elaine Stritch's strength, along with the film's, comes from her honesty. She is herself, even when - maybe especially when - she knows she's being watched.	2014-03-13
What a tough, difficult, talented old broad.	2014-03-13
Really, the experience of "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me" is the experience of being in Stritch's company for 80 minutes, and that's fine. Still I doubt anyone will walk out of this film wishing it were 10 minutes longer.	2014-03-13
By the end, even those who had never heard of Stritch can share her rage against the dying of the light.	2014-03-13
Refusing insincerity, demanding attention, and committed to the art of performance, Stritch's life seems tailor-made for a documentary.	2014-03-12
In the marvelous documentary Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me, the title figure is a pistol.	2014-03-09
An enjoyably fawning documentary.	2014-03-07
This is a must-see for anyone who loves theater, acting and especially individuals like Elaine Stritch unafraid to bare their souls -- so all of us can gain more insight into the complicated essence of the human condition.	2014-03-07
Stritch, in her trademark billowy white blouses and skinny black tights, or in bed, without makeup and without, sometimes, a lucid notion, reveals herself to be full of opposing emotions and desires.	2014-03-07
This profile of stage and screen veteran Elaine Stritch, shot during her 87th year, isn't a documentary so much as an improvised star vehicle; she plays to the camera through the entire movie and puts on a hell of a show.	2014-03-06
You watch "Shoot Me" wishing this woman could keep sashaying through her showbiz life forever ...	2014-03-06
The movie's a portrait of tough yet vulnerable woman fighting age with everything she's got, giving in, getting scared, fighting some more.	2014-03-06
Formidable, indomitable, irascible: Pick your adjective, and it pretty much describes the force of nature who holds the stage in "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me."	2014-03-06
"I Feel Pretty," from "West Side Story," was written for an ingenue, not a grande dame in her ninth decade, but she sings it with delicious irony, self-irony and irrepressible delight.	2014-03-06
I suppose it helps to have seen Stritch onstage to fully appreciate the bracing new documentary "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me," released by Sundance Selects. I wish I'd seen more.	2014-03-06
She's an original straight-shooter, and the doc's not far from a bull's-eye.	2014-03-06
She is more than a little abrasive in the finished documentary, yet she is also compulsively watchable. No wonder she's a star.	2014-03-06
One of those showbiz docs that's not exactly pleasurable but offers a penetrating glimpse - sometimes too penetrating - into what it means to eat, drink, and be contrary in the public sphere.	2014-02-27
Irresistibly brash and deeply moving, "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me" is a vanity-free portrait of a phenomenal artist.	2014-02-26
Ever the trooper, [Stritch] grabs the audience's attention, which never wanes. There's not one diffident moment. Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me is the natural-born sequel to her stage show and just as revealing.	2014-02-25
Inspirational, entertaining, and absolutely awards-caliber...Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me offers up an indelible and rare experience in cinematic form-it's simply an absolute treat to be able to spend this much intimate time with such a legendary lady.	2014-02-21
Follows the groundwork laid out by the recent Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work, alternating between look-where-she's-been historical footage and look-at-her-go glimpses of her current busy schedule.	2014-02-21
Cheers to a movie as gloriously entertaining and bluntly honest as the lady herself. Everybody rise.	2014-02-21
Delicious, hilarious, brutally honest up-close and riveting portrait of octogenarian Broadway/film/TV legend and still alive-wire Elaine Stritch will thrill her many fans and win her plenty of new ones.	2014-02-21
Ultimately, "Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me" borders on inspirational in the way that it humanizes someone this undeniably talented and successful.	2014-02-21
Stritch speaks honestly about her mortality. At 87, she harbors no fantasies about extended amounts of time. Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me makes you wish she would live forever.	2014-02-21
You'd have to be inept not to get good material when you turn a camera on the irrepressible Elaine Stritch. Fortunately, first-time director Chiemi Karasawa earned the actress' complete trust...	2014-02-21
A generous and hilarious portrait of life as an aging legend.	2014-02-20
On a deeper level, "Shoot Me" is an unflinchingly honest examination of a woman who is aware that the end is approaching.	2014-02-20
Every would-be director of a celebrity biography should be required to watch Chiemi Karasawa's delightful example.	2014-02-20
It's Stritch at her Stritchiest: swaddled in fur, showing off those stockinged gams that still refuse to quit, and parking her eyes behind a pair of those signature oversized glasses that look like two full moons resting on her face.	2014-02-20
'Shoot Me' paints a loving but prickly and honest portrait of someone who's never been less than honest, if sometimes to a fault.	2014-02-20
The chief pleasures of Shoot Me-and there are many-come from watching Stritch navigate her day-to-day life.	2014-02-20
Ms. Stritch is sharp, funny, brittle, caustic, demanding, exaggerated, critical (especially of herself) and infuriating. She is also elaborately unique and awesomely brilliant.	2014-02-19
An irresistibly entertaining documentary that captures Stritch during what she unsentimentally calls ''almost post-time.''	2014-02-19
As much a playdate as portrait, a jumble of salty highlights attesting to the pleasure of her company.	2014-02-18
It's gratifying beyond words to witness this consummate performer as she feeds off an audience's energy, turning flubs and forgetfulness continually to her advantage.	2014-02-18
You can't kid a kidder, and she's a truth machine set on "Play" at all times. She may kid herself occasionally, but you get the impression it's a rare occurrence.	2014-02-18
Chiemi Karasawa's documentary is remarkable for its candor, but it's a brutal honesty that Elaine Stritch herself gladly offers.	2014-02-17
You can't take your eyes off of her.	2013-10-23
The movie acts as the quintessential celebration of a thoroughly distinctive character.	2013-10-23
The beauty of this adaptation of Belgian author and illustrator Gabrielle Vincent's characters is its sheer simplicity and sincerity.	2014-05-24
Contains not one speck of the post-modern snark that has plagued animated movies for over a decade. It has no interest in being 'with it.'	2014-05-02
Completely charming with a retro storybook look.	2014-05-02
The film's main message is that friendship knows no bounds and that once one sees behind preconceived notions, a new world of possibilities can bloom.	2014-04-11
absolutely fine and entirely likeable	2014-04-10
Ernest learns to share, Celestine learns to a paint - and the audience learns that in a Disney-dominated marketplace, kids are still free to choose their own mini mouse.	2014-04-10
...has a refreshing lightness that's rare in animation these days.	2014-04-07
Ernest & Celestine is a magnificent, creative, and visionary piece of work that is heartwarming, magical, and just a fantastic cinematic journey that will be forever timeless.	2014-04-05
One of the most charming animated films ever made.	2014-04-04
Delightful art and a cute story of inter-species co-existence.	2014-04-04
The unlikely cross-species friendship of Celestine the mouse and Ernest the bear teaches a gentle lesson about irrational intolerance in this French animated charmer.	2014-04-03
"Ernest & Celestine" draws on plenty of classics, animated and otherwise, for inspiration, but the film manages to be delightful on its own offbeat terms.	2014-04-03

The pace and the style of E&C, not to mention its wonderful attention to detail, lift the film from being merely sweet to being something special.	2014-04-03
Gorgeous, humorous, and endearing, I don't think there's a single frame in Ernest & Celestine that isn't absolutely wonderful.	2014-04-02
Despite the rumors of its demise, 2D hand-drawn animation isn't dead. In fact it's becoming vital again in Europe, and this is a brilliant example of what it could be again.	2014-04-02
"Ernest & Celestine" is a charming animated feature that is about tolerance, understanding and, most of all, the power of friendship.	2014-03-30

Ernest & Celestine is a genuine charmer for kids, and for the parental units tagging alongside.	2014-03-28

A joyous rediscovery of hand-drawn animation, all witty and expressive lines, spare backgrounds and gorgeous, watery hues.	2014-03-27
It moves with the rhythms and emotions of classic kids' literature, possesses elegance and belly laughs in equal measure, and is almost magically beautiful to look at. And, like bears, it has bite.	2014-03-27
The message is simple, the ending earthshaking and a few scenes border on overly precious. But as the stakes are raised for the pair, a surprising depth of character emerges.	2014-03-27
It's hand-drawn, in squiggly, imperfect lines on white backgrounds that aren't always completely filled in. This makes it look like an old children's book tucked away in a box in your parents' basement.	2014-03-26
The film conveys valuable lessons about friendship and acceptance without compromising its humor and charm.	2014-03-25
as unique and delicate as an antique Valentine.	2014-03-23
Out-charms both Frozen and The Wind Rises	2014-03-21
Delicate animation and a charming score may be why this Belgian film earned an Oscar nomination. Its story, however, makes no sense whatsoever.	2014-03-20

This slender, but sweet buddy comedy boasts lovely 2D animation, a great story and, best of all, a distinctly original world that keeps revealing new surprises.	2014-03-14
It has things to say about the world, but it does so gracefully, without hitting you over the head with them.	2014-03-14
Ernest & Celestine isn't just cute or thrilling, though: It's openly funny, in a wry, unpredictable way [...] It explores the silly side of the bear/mouse dynamic without puncturing the specificity that makes the story work.	2014-03-14
The enchanting French-Belgian animated feature Ernest & Celestine is so liltingly sweet and graceful that, a day or two after I saw it, it seemed almost as if I had dreamed it.	2014-03-14

The movie advances the art of animation without seeming to try.	2014-03-13

Marked as outsiders by their respective societies, an unlikely friendship is forged, an ill-tempered uproar unleashed, and a delightful movie is the result.	2014-02-28
The characters are computer-rendered, but the watercolor environments they move in are expressive and detail-rich.	2014-02-27
Kids will enjoy it for its sheer loopiness, while adult fans of animation can revel in its divergence from every other 'toon in town.	2014-02-27
Might be the most ridiculously cute movie I've ever seen, in a way that transforms adorableness into something honest and wise and deeply satisfying.	2014-02-26
The film's gorgeous, hand-drawn animation is as lovingly detailed as the drawings a girl mouse named Celestine is secretly making about an imaginary mouse and bear friendship.	2014-02-25

We Are The Best is, well, one of the best and without giving anything away, I can assure you that its grand finale is as wonderfully satisfying as any ending that I have seen in a long time.	2014-06-03
There are sweet moments and Grosin's dynamic performance percolates, but "We Are the Best!" is more tedious than anarchic.	2014-06-03
There just aren't enough films about teen-age girl punk bands made by left-wing feminist Swedish Christian males.	2014-06-02
We Are the Best! is an infectiously funny coming-of-age story, led by three invigorating, nuanced performances from its young cast.	2014-05-31
The unpatronizing way their growing pains are portrayed, while not ever losing a sense of perspective and humor is a key element of what makes the film so beguiling...	2014-05-30

The movie is refreshingly sensitive to gender, but also transcends it. What unites the three clashing heroines is their resistance to conventional cliques and schoolhouse conformity. In more ways than one, they're a band of outsiders.	2014-05-30
When the girls chant the film's titular mantra, not only do we feel like it's true, we feel we've earned the right to chant along.	2014-05-30
The film's winsome, self-satisfied comedy will no doubt appeal more to viewers who prize juvenile hi-jinks over the cultural moment it depicts.	2014-05-30
Audiences can be pleased to find a story in which its young female characters aren't victims, or even pretty little liars, but just friends. And good ones, at that.	2014-05-30
There are movies with much bigger budgets slamming into theaters, but I'll be you won't see one with more honest exuberance or spot on charm than this one.	2014-05-29
If ever a movie earned the exclamation point in its title, it's Lukas Moodysson's "We Are the Best!"	2014-05-29
We Are the Best! scrapes, if sometimes a little lazily, for its spiky heroines to be appreciated on their own terms, half-understood though they might be.	2014-05-29
Tests of friendship, boy troubles and a climactic show at a rival community centre ensue. And though the story meanders, Moodysson wins us over by capturing the restlessness, confusion and excitement of being young and finding your voice.	2014-05-29
We are the Best! is smart, funny and real, an honest peek into the secret lives of girls.	2014-05-29
What we have here is an exhilarating blast of a movie, full of heart but still punk rock... We Are the Best! is loud, crude, socially irresponsible and totally irresistible.	2014-05-29
Despite the unruly music at its center, the filmmaker has crafted a uniformly gentle ode to growing up.	2014-05-29

No film I've seen so far this year has provided the sheer moviegoing pleasure of "We Are the Best!''	2014-05-28
It portrays the kind of rush of unfettered, probably crap inspiration that one relishes before self-criticism and self-doubt kicks in.	2014-05-28
[...] We Are The Best! captures both the spirit of the early 1980s and the way pre-teens and teens have their own ideas of what's important.	2014-05-28
So add We Are the Best! to the growing canon of excellent girl-band movies...And in this film, being in a band is a way to find yourself.	2014-05-28
Exclamation points seem entirely apropos: it's the best!	2014-05-28
A classic coming-of-age story that embraces the messiness and stubbornness of adolescence, delivering a drama that is alive with attitude, humor and heart.	2014-05-28
The movie has the confidence of an artist who's survived some wild years himself, experimenting with style and dispassion and realizing that sweet abandon is more than enough.	2014-05-28
A charming delight that's going to leave you wanting to form your own punk band on leaving the theater.	2014-05-27

Funny and frank in its observations, the film is a delightful snapshot of female friendship at that age, from the giddy highs to the melancholy funks, from the sustaining bonds to the jealousies and stinging betrayals.	2014-05-27
Lukas Moodysson's film allows its trio of girls to express themselves through gender, certainly, but not undermine their desire to be heard as artists first.	2014-05-27
Punk has never been so adorably, girl or Swedish	2014-05-26
Three female teenagers trying to stick together in a world that is stacked against them in Stockholm, circa 1982.	2014-05-25
Era-specific but never nostalgic, tender but never sentimental, We Are the Best!, like all good films about teenage girls, finely illuminates the emotional extremes of this tumultuous development stage.	2014-05-21
With fantastic performances by the three leads (only one of whom is a professional actor), the film fluidly alternates between the messiness and warmth of female friendship.	2014-05-09
A look at three middle-school aged kids ostracized by their peers for being non-conforming, punk band aspirants. Well acted by the young trio but they are simply not interesting enough to rivet my attention.	2014-05-06
Punk rock has never been this bubbly on screen, but that's what happens when you cast three actresses with infectiously effervescent personalities and deep-rooted chemistry.	2014-05-01
Swedish filmmaker Lukas Moodysson returns to the improv-style charms of his earlier films (like Together and Show Me Love), a welcome break from his more recent grim experimental dramas (see Mammoth or Lilya 4-ever).	2014-04-23
Performances from the central players are uniformly remarkable and help distract from a slightly disjointed, episodic structure. Content is fairly lightweight and the movie runs out of road towards the conclusion, but it is fun while it lasts.	2014-04-22
It offers arguments for rebellion and for creative aggression. It sparkles with the unpredictability of youth.	2014-04-21
Brisk, authentically snotty stuff, with nice barbs at the expense of self-indulgent ex-hippy parents, lumbering heavy metallists and pompous youth workers.	2014-04-20
You'd have to have a heart of Arctic ice to finish the film not smiling with joy.	2014-04-18
A good mystery tale to tell of a governess in the suburban Chicago area.	2014-06-03
One of the first great documentaries of the year.	2014-05-30

Maier had that unique ability to capture, in an image, an entire world, one that takes far more than a thousand words to tell.	2014-04-17
This is an amazing tale, and Maloof has labored mightily to flesh it out. He's almost as odd as Maier was.	2014-04-17
Through dogged research and interviews with the (now-grown) children Maier cared for, along with their parents (including Phil Donahue), a profile emerges, and it's fascinating.	2014-04-17

Directors John Maloof and Charlie Siskel do a lot with what they have -- but they also had a lot to work with.	2014-04-03
The portrait Maloof and Siskel assemble here from the scant information available suggests that her fanatical privacy was the darkroom in which her distinctive artistic personality was developed.	2014-04-03
The movie does nearly everything right in its chosen, compact, 83-minute form.	2014-04-03
Finding Vivian Maier treats Maier's background as a puzzle that doubles as self-promotion, supporting her photographs with an amazing story that gives them context-and [...] stokes more interest in her work.	2014-04-01

Maloof's vibrancy and wide-eyed curiosity for Vivian's work is incredibly affecting and pierces through the screen.	2014-03-30

A stunning minimalist erotic thriller that explores with arresting photography and economical use of dialogue how human identity is defined, and sometimes imprisoned, by our desires, drives, and passions.	2014-03-14
Alain Guiraudie allows the chosen genre styles and structures to freely blend and merge. The transitions between thriller, comedy and romance are sometimes almost indiscernible.	2014-03-13
Gratuitousness (some scenes are simply porn) overshadows the crux of the tale, namely Franck's libido taking precedence over his conscience and the risk that he may become an accomplice.	2014-03-07
Sex, murder, and tension in a tranquil setting	2014-03-07
Unsettling, suspenseful and sad, it's a movie that sticks with you long after it's over.	2014-03-07
Carefully and often brilliantly creates its own Eden-like universe.	2014-03-06
There's too much metaphysical packaging material in the story; it's half Styrofoam peanuts. But its ideas are intriguing and its murky suspense is undeniable.	2014-03-06
What sets the engrossing "Stranger by the Lake" apart is that its excesses seem to point to a moral purpose beyond shock or entertainment value.	2014-03-06
Claire Mathon's brilliant cinematography finds an appositely sinister glare in the shimmering water and sunny skies.	2014-02-28
However you read it, the film is compelling and audaciously candid in its erotic charge, while an ending that literally leaves us in the dark is one of the most haunting sign-offs in recent cinema.	2014-02-23
This death trip homoerotic thriller, influenced by Hitchcock, is powerful, weird, and intoxicating - until its final scenes.	2014-02-23
It shimmers with that intoxicating sun-on-the-water allure that might make someone not quite themselves.	2014-02-21
Alain Guiraudie's thriller is characterised both by its formal ingenuity and its surprisingly graphic gay sex. The plotting rekindles memories both of Patricia Highsmith novels and of Hitchcock films.	2014-02-21
As an exercise in style, this minimalist noir erotic thriller is pretty cool. But it loses its way somewhere around the midpoint and never quite finds it again.	2014-02-21
Like a wry scientist, wading through the jungle, Guiraudie notes every tiny, unwritten law. It's infectious stuff.	2014-02-21
Even though this dramatic thriller is set in a place most viewers will be unable to identify with, filmmaker Alain Guiraudie and his cast draw us in completely.	2014-02-21
When was the last time you saw an erotic thriller that worked simultaneously on both levels?	2014-02-20
A simple and ruthlessly effective exercise in minimal narrative and style, Alain Guiraudie's moral tale is so restrained and atmospheric that the nudity and graphic sex don't upstage the creepy mood of seductive, inescapable doom.	2014-02-20
I thought the film silly if endearing. Fluff noir. Others, peering into the crystal, see and prophesy a cult future for filmmaker Alain Guiraudie.	2014-02-20
Guiraudie's film is acutely brilliant on the funny, scary machinery of desire, and how easily humans can get caught up in its cogwheels.	2014-02-20
Alain Guiraudie - remember that name.	2014-02-20
A gripping and superbly directed picture with something to say about the nature of infatuation and obsession.	2014-02-20
The motivations may be questionable, but desire has a way of clouding even the clearest heads.	2014-02-19
Desire, danger and death - Guiraudie uses the water's edge as a playground for hedonistic predators and willing prey.	2014-02-17
Beautifully crafted, sinister, frightening, erotic and thought-provoking, Alain Guiraudie's multi-faceted Cannes triumph is already one of the most provocative, intriguing films of the year.	2014-02-17
Sun, sex, psychosis, skinny-dipping: it sounds like genre tat, but Guiraudie's dark, droll study of a risky attraction upends expectations. It plays by stealth, but its sly grip is sure.	2014-02-17
Notable already for its depiction of real sex, it's explicit in other ways too: a depiction of amoral attraction that deserves a wider audience than mere fans of elegant congress.	2014-02-16
A sophisticated, unpredictable and original modern noir.	2014-02-14
Oddly for such a suspenseful film, Stranger by the Lake is rather encouraging in its insistence on the different shapes that human connection can take.	2014-02-12
Hitchcock by way of Cruising.	2014-02-12
Guiraudie's telling is fairly cold-blooded, but the choreographed dance of desire and disappointment still manages to intrigue.	2014-02-11
Will reward film fans who have admired Claude Chabrol and the screen adaptations of Patricia Highsmith.	2014-02-07
This lake is a sexual refuge, about to be stained by sin and blood.	2014-02-07
Movies must go somewhere, plots must always kick in, and when this one does, that's where "Stranger by the Lake" begins to contract into something less creative than its odd setting and compelling compositions would suggest.	2014-02-06
Guiraudie questions the limits of heedless sexual indulgence at the expense of all other considerations.	2014-02-03
So studiously controlled that it's not an easy picture to watch, but you won't forget it.	2014-01-31
French filmmaker Alain Guiraudie's tantalizingly erotic fable of love, passion and death.	2014-01-30
Writer-director Alain Guiraudie has an imagistic talent for suspense and erotic byplay.	2014-01-30
The film submits a magnificent escalation of concern and characterization that supports the entire effort. The long road to a climatic payoff is well worth the wait.	2014-01-30
The film is a Hitchcockian murder story in which the Hitchcockian elements-style as well as content-are stood on their heads in order to realize a philosophical vision that's no less sophisticated than Hitchcock's own.	2014-01-24
The kind of taut, low-key thriller that Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock would very much admire.	2014-01-24
Everything, from the sex to the relationships to the genre elements, is in a bothersome but no less captivating state of flux.	2014-01-24
Though it'll be confined to the art house circuit, Stranger By the Lake actually has all the ingredients of a mainstream, page-turning summer beach read.	2014-01-24
So much of this beguiling film's beauty is in how it sneaks up on you, the way genre elements quietly insinuate their way into the story.	2014-01-24
A thing of beauty that overstays its welcome. It's possible that Pawlikowski would be a great artist if he weren't so hellbent on convincing us of it.	2014-06-05
Pawlikowski unfolds the story quietly and deliberately, with stunning black and white cinematography giving the movie an austere, otherworldly feel.	2014-06-05
...those willing to appreciate finely etched character studies of two women, trying to make sense of a discovered or rediscovered Jewish past, will find this both engaging and moving.	2014-06-04
I was drawn in by the incredible beauty of Ida's photography to the point of alienation from the complex story through which such images unfolded in front of me.	2014-06-02
An artistic triumph whose stunning simplicity conveys an entire world of moral complexity and human pain.	2014-05-30
A masterpiece.	2014-05-30
"Ida" is a story of faith and identity, an exquisite, austere drama in a plaintive minor key.	2014-05-29
Beautifully crafted all around, keeping Ida engrossing as it explores screen stillness, putting its faith in the power of subtle revelations as a means of suspense.	2014-05-29
The Polish drama "Ida" is a rarity, a film both intensely grounded in painful historical reality and genuinely otherworldly.	2014-05-29
Ida is a film that will stay in the minds of audiences for days after the credits have rolled.	2014-05-27
Life is full of strangeness. Ida offers up a quixotic glimpse at the human condition, and a diversion from the expected...	2014-05-26
Anyone with trouble sleeping should trot along to this boring Polish drama about a young nun (Agata Trzebuchowska) who discovers some dark secrets in her family.	2014-05-24
A film that stirs emotions and begs us never to forget that the biggest atrocities can have the most intimate of outcomes.	2014-05-23
Remarkably well-made character study, brimming with emotion and sublimated conflict.	2014-05-23
Spare, haunting and in its own way beautiful, "Ida" is an absorbing film about discovering the truth, and the attendant price we pay to learn it.	2014-05-22
Pawel Pawlikowski's hushed, elemental story of a young Polish woman's discovery of her history and herself in the early 1960s as she's about to take vows as a nun shimmers with beauty and detail: it's breathtakingly great.	2014-05-22
A quiet, sparsely plotted film that grows in memory.	2014-05-22
Ida reaches spiritual depth through affecting performances rendered in sublime black-and-white compositions. Cinematographer Lukasz Zal places faces in the lower corner of his frame to arresting effect.	2014-05-22
For a film about grave moral questions and contradictions, "Ida" possesses more than its share of sensory pleasures ...	2014-05-22
Ida has the look and feel of a 1960s black-and-white "art" movie without artsy pretentiousness.	2014-05-22
"Ida" accomplishes so much, so surely in its 80 minutes, it's as if the director Pawel Pawlikowski had dared himself: How can I tell this fascinating story efficiently yet without rushing and abridging the narrative?	2014-05-22
Turns what should have been a complex mystery into a simple question and answer.	2014-05-22
Ida is a gorgeous and humble tale of stiff upper lips and scars that refuse to heal, where every frame is imbued with melancholic beauty and a quiet grace.	2014-05-21
Pawlikawski's approach is austere and subdued, capturing a sense of spiritual tranquility with a purity and economy of form that is rare outside of a Bresson or Dreyer film, yet with a political and moral fervor that this type of material demands.	2014-05-20
The black-and-white cinematography has a luminous clarity. This is one of those films it is impossible to imagine in colour. And the performances, without exception, seem flawless.	2014-05-19
It's an elegant miniature that illuminates grander, sadder themes.	2014-05-15
Likely to remain the best movie of the year.	2014-05-15
By the end of the film, you know [Anna] has changed inside, but the import of that change remains entirely her business -- which is the aspect of Ida I most admire, and also the one that makes me most uneasy.	2014-05-13
Ida is austere, it's beautiful, but I don't know that I completely get all that Pawlikowski is trying to say with this.	2014-05-13
The parable resonates emotionally thanks to Trzebuchowska's performance.	2014-05-09
A stunning character portrait of survival and loss.	2014-05-08
[The] screenplay is a model of economy, as precise as the lensing by Ryszard Lenczewski and Lukasz Zal, who often position their subjects at the bottom of the frame, emphasizing personal insignificance within the totalitarian machine.	2014-05-08
Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida is a remarkably beautiful film.	2014-05-07
Ida stings, but in wonderfully alarming ways.	2014-05-07
This is solemn filmmaking, devoutly restrained and unshakably purposeful. We expect its austerity to fend us off, but no; it gathers us in and forbids us to look away.	2014-05-06
The effect is somewhere between incredible beauty and mounting discomfort.	2014-05-06
Quite soon in watching Ida, you recognize that you are going to have to see the picture again and again.	2014-05-06
Introspective and retrospective at once, transformative, self exploratory and with its final destination remaining elusive, as classic road movies ought to be.	2014-05-05
An exquisitely beautiful road trip through the emotional consequences of exposing Poland's expedient secrets and denials. . . conveyed through very expressive faces.	2014-05-03
Ida is barely 80 minutes and lacks fullness, and the style that's so arresting can also seem studied. But the movie's chill is hard to shake off.	2014-05-02
What comes across is a vast woefulness for what the war did to Poland and all its people. Amid this darkness and dread, Ida is like a transcendent beacon.	2014-05-02
There's an urgency to Ida's simple, elemental story that makes it seem timely, or maybe just timeless.	2014-05-02
Riveting, original and breathtakingly accomplished on every level, "Ida" would be a masterpiece in any era, in any country.	2014-05-02
The finest work yet from a terrific filmmaker. And, one can only hope, the one that begins to bring him the attention he deserves.	2014-05-02
A quiet, patient movie that runs a mere 80 minutes, but in the fashion of the best cinematic works offers a world of riches just below the surface.	2014-05-01
It is Trzebuchowska's face, and her character's situation, her existential and practical journey, that hold our interest in "Ida."	2014-05-01
Within its relatively brief duration and its narrow black-and-white frames, the movie somehow contains a cosmos of guilt, violence and pain.	2014-05-01
The performances are beyond reproach. As Wanda, Agata Kulesza is mournfully magnetic. As Ida, Agata Trzebuchowska expresses a complex consciousness budding up from behind her sweet blank slate.	2014-05-01
Yes, I'm recommending a black-and-white film about a nun and a judge in Communist-era Poland.	2014-05-01
Everyone is on a voyage of self-discovery in Ida - the two central characters certainly, but also Poland-born, Britain-based director Pawel Pawlikowski, making his first film in the homeland he left at 14.	2014-05-01
Exceptional, mature film dazzles, offers haunting insights.	2014-05-13
"The Great Beauty" is a great romance: a man and a city and a love that cannot be consummated but which will consume you surely. Somewhere, Baz Luhrmann weeps.	2014-04-04
If it sounds a bit ponderous, well, maybe it is, but it's also smart, warm-hearted and sumptuously shot.	2014-03-27
'The Great Beauty' is certainly striking, but too often what it's striking are poses.	2014-03-10
It's La Dolce Vita for the 21st century, of course. But, more than that, it's the rare work that not only tips its hat to a masterpiece but sort of shockingly tops it.	2014-03-05
A mysterious, sensual prism through which to view our own shortcomings and longings.	2014-03-04
The Great Beauty boils over with shapeless disdain, aimed everywhere but where it should be	2014-03-02
As a parody of Italian cinema, it's tedious. Except we're supposed to be taking this seriously. As if.	2014-03-02
I don't know that I've ever seen a film in which the visual glory on the screen was so at odds with the philosophy evident in the screenplay.	2014-02-22
The Great Beauty (or, more wonderfully, La Grande Bellezza) is a memory play, a meditation on life, a celebration of the incidentals that make it joyous and more.	2014-02-21
Ah, to be wealthy, gorgeous and dead inside in Rome!	2014-02-21
For those of us who spend most of our time still dealing with rent and health care, it is a two-hour journey into ideas and emotions we only wish there were time to consider. That's a reason to go to the movies.	2014-02-17
The Great Beauty will become one of those movies that will be discussed over and over again in future college courses.	2014-02-13
Wild set-pieces and rueful observations are the stock in trade of this Italian film by one of the modern masters of cinema, Paolo Sorrentino.	2014-02-13
2 hours and 20 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.	2014-02-09
There's little to discover in Paolo Sorrentino's satiric vision of Rome, except perhaps, that some cities just look better than others while entertaining themselves to hell.	2014-02-08
Sorrentino's film may flit between vignettes of extravagance and eccentricity, but more is always toiling underneath.	2014-02-07
With inevitable debt to Fellini, Sorrentino's nods as reverential as they are wry.	2014-02-06
I can't remember when a film last gave me such a surge of pure pleasure -- no, outright euphoria -- as The Great Beauty.	2014-02-06
"...a sumptuous elegy."	2014-01-31
Cut from similarly sexy and satirical cloth as Federico Fellini's masterworks a half-century ago, Paolo Sorrentino's movie glides like reverie, probing the emptiness that can result from living a full life.	2014-01-31
The Great Beauty is an utterly ravishing portrait of listless luxuriance, a fantasy of decadent wealth and beauty that evokes Fellini's La Dolce Vita by way of Baz Luhrmann.	2014-01-31
A spectacular film, as messy, strange and funny as a dream, with hedonistic party scenes to rival The Great Gatsby.	2014-01-31
The intelligently observed and staggeringly beautiful Italian foreign-language Oscar nominee is about life, death and the search for the things that give meaning to both.	2014-01-30
Sorrentino has managed to build a loving and distinctive work on the foundation of an indolent, often self-loathing social strata.	2014-01-30
Celebrating Rome in all its decay, this florid comedy by Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo, This Must Be the Place) opens with a hyperbolically gaudy party honoring a celebrity journalist on his 65th birthday.	2014-01-30
A riotous film that finds depth, clarity and refreshment in even the shallowest of pools.	2014-01-30
The title is about as spot on as you can get and this is ultimately a film that raises the search for beauty in this world to a stylish art.	2014-01-29
This is quite simply glorious filmmaking.	2014-01-29
For all its high-brow posturing, this film is tedious.	2014-01-25
Borrowing liberally from the spirit of famed countryman Federico Fellini's 1960 classic La Dolce Vita, Sorrentino emerges with an existential fantasy steeped in Italy's rich cinematic history, with feet firmly planted in the present.	2014-01-24
It's not surprising that Oscar voters fell for the charms of this Italian odyssey, since it's essentially a love letter to Fellini and Rome.	2014-01-24
An elegant, existentially enigmatic meditation on opulence and decadence.	2014-01-22
The title feels appropriate because this is a film to be enjoyed as much for its beautiful imagery as its stimulating storyline.	2014-01-21
One of the most 'Italian' films I've ever seen; passionate, satirical, and sumptuous	2014-01-20
It's not often that we feel ravaged by a film, but The Great Beauty is a ravager, a spectacular odyssey of emotion and intellect and sensuality through the rich, contradictory and self indulgent world of The Eternal City	2014-01-17
Uncovers both the superficial and the profound in this exploration of life, death and the inspirations that keep things interesting	2014-01-17
It's high-minded, dealing in heady truths about life, art, narcissism, creativity and spirituality. It's subtitled. Everyone speaks Italian. Also, nothing explodes.	2014-01-17
Throughout the film, Sorrentino delivers gorgeous images, crazy images, startling and sexy and serene images; it's a visual bath of sorts - the great beauty is everywhere, Jep (and we) just have to be open to it.	2014-01-16
A little La Dolce Vita, bits of Last Year at Marienbad, and flashes of Russian Ark.	2014-01-09
Though there's precious little drama, Sorrentino's skills as an image-maker are indisputable.	2014-01-08
Frenetic portrait of Rome's elite recalls La Dolce Vita and Ulysses	2014-01-02
An Italian film that dazzles the eye	2014-01-02
It's a beauty, all right. It's more a style show than a deep philosophical treatise, but with surfaces this sleek and faces this interesting, I'll take style over substance any day.	2014-01-02
A seductive, woeful meditation on phony efforts and the challenge of living for the moment.	2014-01-02
Even those who find it overstuffed, opaque and derivative will be bowled over by its sheer pictorial extravagance and visual sheen.	2013-12-13
Go ahead. Soak up the Beauty. It's one of the best films of the year.	2013-12-12
Sometimes all you want from a movie is more. Sorrentino's opulent carnival of modern Rome is the most more you could ever hope to see.	2013-12-10
Plays at times like a more conventional, less daring version of 1972&rsquo;s Roma...On its own merits, Sorrentino&rsquo;s film ain&rsquo;t half-bad, but it&rsquo;s no Fellini picture.	2013-12-06
Leave your iPhone at home for this one or you will buy a plane ticket to Rome before you can escape the theatre.	2013-12-01
Simple in concept but complex in its detail... engrossing and suspenseful.	2014-06-05
What seems like a limited stunt concept turns out to be one of the most intense -- and cinematic -- experiences of the year, anchored to a brilliant performance by Tom Hardy.	2014-06-05
Hardy gives a spellbinding performance.	2014-06-02
That writer ("Eastern Promises") and director ("Redemption") Steven Knight introduces Ivan Locke as his only visible character speaks volumes about his own self-confidence as a filmmaker.	2014-05-29
...this potentially claustrophobic experience is transformed into a rich emotional epic, one of the most satisfying and whole-feeling movies of the past few years,	2014-05-24
An expertly tuned dramatic thriller that, like Ivan Locke, has no time to slowdown.	2014-05-23
What we get is an intimate portrayal of a man's life as it implodes. And that is heartbreaking to watch.	2014-05-23
Continues the idea, seen in Cronenberg's 'Cosmopolis,' that the car is no longer a refuge and a symbol of freedom but an extension of the home and office -- a mobile space that through technology remains connected to the pressures of work and family.	2014-05-23
Construction and cracks, choices and consequences, decisions and detours, right and wrong, and frailty and strength are woven into a masterstroke of storytelling and minimalist filmmaking.	2014-05-21
Tom Hardy makes a very compelling case that he could indeed make a spoken word interpretation of the white pages absolutely riveting viewing.	2014-05-20
Knight's script is taut and tense, ramping up the emotional stress and parceling out details and complications with a surgeon's skill.	2014-05-20
Locke runs an efficient 85 minutes, and it's a testament to Knight's skills that we feel we learn a lot about the characters in what out of necessity are pretty broad brushstrokes.	2014-05-17
Locke has its flaws, but manages to satisfy as a minimalist work of social realism that is both dramatically-rich and often quite engaging.	2014-05-16
"Locke" is one riveting film.	2014-05-16
That solo time in the car, predictably, gets trying to watch.	2014-05-15
A brilliant one-man, one-setting character study	2014-05-15
For the most part, it works like gangbusters.	2014-05-15
Take a ride with Tom Hardy in this beautiful, gripping film.	2014-05-15
Knight's genius, beyond dialogue and direction, lies in being able to depict how layers of personality slide against each other, and how the constructs we create serve our lives.	2014-05-15
The extreme contrivance of the scenario extends to a lot of Locke's lines to the people he's on the phone with. It may never leave the car, but it wants to stuff that car full of as much meaning and drama as it can.	2014-05-15
A one-man tour de force for Tom Hardy.	2014-05-15
A restless, nervy actor, Hardy seems to get a kick out of tying one hand behind his back	2014-05-15
As intriguing as Hardy is to watch, the picture can't overcome its cinematic-stunt vibe.	2014-05-15
Hardy's strong performance holds the movie together, but after nearly 90 minutes in the car with him, it's a bit of a relief when the ride is over.	2014-05-14
It's a fascinating instance of a filmmaker working with self-imposed rules, but never forgetting that those restrictions are only worthwhile to the extent that they serve character and story.	2014-05-13
An intriguing yet not-altogether-successful experiment...	2014-05-13
...works better than it should, given its extremely limiting conceit.	2014-05-12
Locke wastes little time accelerating into exceptional territory, but it slows down and makes a sharp turn onto an under construction detour that slows the film down bringing it to an abrupt halt.	2014-05-09
As in real life, it's neither sweet nor uplifting, but it's a must-see.	2014-05-09
The crises Ivan Locke faces with a tremendous will to do the right thing strike a chord. The mistakes that have him in the driver's seat, but hardly in control, are terribly human and all too familiar.	2014-05-09
Knight's strength is his writing, and arguably, Locke would be almost as good set on a stage with a man sitting on a chair. But then you'd miss the details of Hardy's face in a film that is all about an actor's vehicle.	2014-05-09
A man, a car, a hands-free mobile device. And it is extraordinary.	2014-05-09
Ultimately, "Locke" is more noteworthy for the process of how it was made than the worthwhileness of the finished outcome, leaving nothing to the imagination while squandering the opportunity to explore what is going on behind Ivan's eyes.	2014-05-08
Creating an entire film around just one actor is a challenge, but Knight has chosen wisely, putting the entire thing on the shoulders of Tom Hardy.	2014-05-08
Hardy makes us care about the mystery of his character, which in turn, clicks the ignition of suspense.	2014-05-08
The film feels like an exercise in dramatic style, and maybe that's enough for some people. But whether it's for me or for the characters, I need an exercise to generate a little more sweat.	2014-05-08
Hardy rises to the gimmick and grounds "Locke" with a performance as watchably charismatic as it is minimalist. You can't take your eyes off him - which is fortunate since there's no one else there.	2014-05-08
In the hands of actor Tom Hardy, the story is surprisingly engrossing and compelling, due to Hardy's great skill as an actor and Knight's finely wrought script.	2014-05-08
Can we talk for a moment about how amazing it is that a movie like this even exists?	2014-05-08
In many ways, the movie feels like the reply to a question: What would happen if we pared down moviemaking to its simplest, most elemental bones?	2014-05-08
Although it might sound like unbearable directorial showmanship, Locke is a crisply defined drama that delivers on suspense and a swirling storm of heartache.	2014-05-08
Director/writer Steven Knight has captured lightning in a bottle -- or at least a BMW.	2014-05-07
Despite Hardy's impressive solo tour de force, 'Locke' is ultimately a talky trip to a pretty sappy destination.	2014-05-05
With tremendous work by actor Tom Hardy anchoring a film that is ripe with dramatic tension, Locke is entirely absorbing despite the limitations imposed by the setting.	2014-05-05
The movie's greatest asset by far is Hardy, whose rich, unflappable tones, even in times of high emotional pressure, bear a distinct echo of Richard Burton ...	2014-05-05
Expensive Hollywood trickery often is superfluous filler for a film that is otherwise too weak at its very core. Character and story matter most, and "Locke" only needs one man in one car to keep you mesmerized for 85 straight minutes.	2014-05-03
One of my favorite movies of the last couple years. Great script, Tom Hardy is f*!&ing brilliant in role.	2014-05-02
Locke is a terrific little film; despite its closed-in setting, it never feels overtheatrical or contrived...the perfect blend of setting and performance.	2014-05-02
This film explores manhood in a way few do: The jaw-clenched man determined to do the right thing, the man set in his course who will not be swayed, the man who has taken his own measure and who cares only for that measure.	2014-05-02
The drama of the film is in Hardy's face...	2014-05-02
Despite these effective touches, the film eventually becomes a bit monotonous: it's clear from very early on that Cornelia is a terrible person, but this doesn't stop Netzer from hammering home the point.	2014-05-19
Exploring morality and forgiveness, mixed with a curious family dynamic, Child's Pose is an involving piece of cinema.	2014-05-18
The pacing is unyieldingly slow, while also missing that sense of creeping escalation that makes the better films of the Romanian art house moment so dreadfully effective	2014-05-16
Calin Peter Netzer is a director unafraid to spend a lot of time in one locale to let the crosscurrents of emotion in a complicated scene play out naturally. The editing is almost invisible as tensions tighten.	2014-05-16
What is so fine about this film is that Cornelia is depicted with subtlety, much of that due to the fine performance of Luminita Gheorghui.	2014-05-13
A thriller, but, like the films of Asghar Farhadi, offers a depth of emotional engagement far beyond your average ... indeed, far beyond your average "straight drama". Its thrills are thrilling, but its drama is intense, moving, and extremely rewarding.	2014-05-11
With its claustrophobic, handheld camerawork, Child's Pose is almost as suffocating as Cornelia (Luminita Gheorghiu), the well meaning but ultimately meddlesome mother ... a showstopping performance by Gheorghiu	2014-05-11
A punchy thriller and sweetly bleak tragicomedy. The last shot is as perfectly shaped and beautiful as a freshly forged chisel. Bare your heart.	2014-04-25
Not a single character bends for our sympathies or campaigns for our support, and for that reason, Child's Pose marks an extremely brave work of remarkable realism.	2014-04-24
For those not driven off by a Mad Libs collection of "emotional tension," "gloomy plot," "grieving parents" and "modern Romania," "Child's Pose" is thrilling.	2014-04-17
A dark piece of neorealism - and a searing indictment of Eastern Europe's newly moneyed classes ...	2014-04-11
A Romanian political allegory - in Romanian - might sound like tough sledding, but thanks to a searing performance by Luminita Gheorghiu, "Child's Pose" is anything but.	2014-04-03
Cinema loves its messed up mother-son relationships. But rarely are they handled with the mastery of Calin Peter Netzer's tale of smotherly love Child's Pose.	2014-03-27
... both acerbic character study and understated indictment of Romania's justice system and entitled inner circle ... Like Angela Lansbury in 'Manchurian Candidate,' Gheorghiu's mother remains oblivious to the damage she has wrought.	2014-03-21
Under the sinuous direction of Calin Peter Netzer, we experience the story as if we were living it.	2014-03-21
Perversely engrossing thanks to Gheorghiu's performance as the queen of denial.	2014-03-20
Netzer crafts not only a chilling story of family dysfunction, but also an illuminating look into the corruption and decay of the Romanian bourgeoisie - without ever overplaying his hand. It all appears so effortless, when in fact it's so skillful.	2014-03-20
A fascinating, troubling and finally controversial portrait of maternal anxiety at its most smotheringly neurotic.	2014-03-13
Raw and frighteningly authentic, the feature has a causal immorality that's fascinating to watch unfold.	2014-03-12
A tour-de-force performance from Gheorghiu carries this 2013 drama along, but Radulescu provides the fine edge, noting how this lioness cloaks her selfish crusade in a plea for humanity.	2014-03-06
It's a chilly story, shot with claustrophobic, close-in cameras, right up to its abrupt ending - in which a mother learns, to her horror, something about the kind of pain that isn't easily swept away.	2014-03-06
Of all the great monster mothers in cinema history, Cornelia Keneres (Luminita Gheorghiu, who sets the standard that other performances should be judged by this year) ranks high on the list.	2014-03-06
Luminita Gheorghlu gives a gripping character study of a woman obsessed with keeping Barbu by her side. Her actions garner both loathing and sympathy, not an easy thing to do.	2014-03-01
Calin Peter Netzer's terrific drama exemplifies many of the traits that have made the new wave of Romanian cinema so fecund.	2014-02-28
It's well worth seeing, both for its merciless anatomization of the country's post-Ceausescu social order and for Gheorghiu's stupendous central performance as a mother so monstrous she makes Medea look like a pushover.	2014-02-23
If Child's Pose fails to live up to its indie-intellectual veneer, it earns its keep through Gheorgiu, whose Cornelia is a triumph of subtle performance over crude conception.	2014-02-21
In the movie world, most national new waves don't last long. An exception is the Romanian renaissance, which has featured first-class movies now for more than a decade.	2014-02-21
"Child's Pose" sounds like something simple and easy, but don't be fooled.	2014-02-20
Writer-director Calin Peter Netzer's thin yet compelling movie is a family drama with elements of political theater and film noir.	2014-02-20
When the stars are aligned-the writing and direction along with the stars in front of the camera-a movie can put the most appalling characters on display and still make them engrossing.	2014-02-20
[T]hrough it all, [Luminita] Gheorghiu finds the perfect pitch between a mother's love for her child and a kind of pathology.	2014-02-20
What starts off as broad melodrama becomes, for lack of a better term, more 'real.'	2014-02-20
Child's Pose treads a delicate line between social horror and comedy-so much so that, as with Lazarescu, it's not always immediately apparent that the comedy is present.	2014-02-20
The movie creates its own tightening vice grip.	2014-02-20
The drained, exhausted, stifling mood is a frequently punitive experience for the viewer.	2014-02-19
Sporting a blonde dye job and a haughty, impervious manner, Gheorghiu makes Cornelia a consistently compelling figure, at once monstrous and pathetic.	2014-02-19
Gheorghiu, who was the essence of compassion in "Lazarescu," creates one of the most complex monster mothers in cinema and Netzer's ambiguous, climatic finale unseats expectations, leaving us to ponder whether maternal love or matriarchal ego is at play.	2014-02-19
A drama with a story as cold, merciless and inevitable as a tomb ...	2014-02-19
The hand-held cinematography, gritty and raw, gives the film an immediate and urgent documentary feel, and each moment has a great sense of both the absurd and the poignant.	2014-02-19
Netzer keeps faith with his countrymen's gritty aesthetic, which remains pure in the spirit of New Wave neo-realism; somehow, international success has not made the Romanians crave CGI or encouraged them to pander to hipness.	2014-02-18
It's wonderful to see [Gheorghiu] in a leading role, especially one as meaty as this.	2014-02-18
"A mother's love" has rarely felt more dagger-like or malevolent than in this chilling morality thriller.	2014-02-18
"Child's Pose" stares at its characters with such intensity that the ordinary becomes surprising and insightful.	2014-02-18
The film thrives on ambiguity, keeping all things blurry outside its main character's focused perspective, its myopia sustained by Lumini&#539;a Gheorghiu's tough, quietly intense performance.	2014-02-17
There is none of the gallows humor that attracts a certain type of viewer to the Romanian New Wave. But the empathy is there, for Cornelia and for Barbu as well, in a film that gets all the way down to the rotten bones.	2014-02-14
A tour de force performance by Luminita Gheorghiu as a controlling mother trying to blast her way back into the life of her thirty-something son.	2014-02-14
Netzer offers a bland simulacrum of documentary reality that lines up precisely with his cliched prejudices. But in the few moments when spontaneous emotion takes over, surprising moments of grace arise.	2014-02-10
Deftly examines loss, dependency, and the delicate bonds that hold families together.	2014-02-05
While lacking the elegant formal conviction of the best Romanian New Wave films, Calin Peter Netzer's Child's Pose is nevertheless a work of sophisticated and affecting storytelling, persuasively enmeshing the fate of individuals with that of society.	2014-01-14
In our society which prizes families above all else (especially that mythical and coveted species, the "decent, hard-working" sort), it is encouraging to find a film that interrogates the pernicious influence that family life can sometimes exert.	2013-12-12
Roger Michell's acidic and poignant film is less "Before Sunrise" and more "Before Midnight."	2014-05-09
Charming "Le Week-End" a Rare Breed	2014-05-02
...might remind you of John Cassavetes' low-budget, high-resolution dramas - there's a wince-inducing realness to the often painful interactions between the couple.	2014-04-27
Duncan's summation of her life at age sixtysomething is as staccato as a telegram with bad news: 'Dissatisfaction -- fury -- and the clock ticking by.'	2014-04-25
Once the characters start explaining the sources of their unhappiness, the drama becomes less compelling, largely because their problems seem far from insurmountable.	2014-04-24
A tale of two Brit boomers looking for lost love in Paris, this is Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? with room service. Broadbent and Duncan have never been better. Their eyes and body language say as much as the dagger-sharp dialog.	2014-04-23
...a forgettable trifle that continually squanders the efforts of its talented cast.	2014-04-20
Such a pleasure to hang with Lindsay Duncan and Jim Broadbent (even when bickering and lamenting).	2014-04-18
The trip is a rewarding one that ends on a note of bittersweet magic that is hopeful without being the least gooey. You need to see this film.	2014-04-16
A playful serio-comedy about marital discord that is more depressing than funny.	2014-04-16
Unsentimental and bittersweet...	2014-04-15
Michell lets Meg and Nick's problems - and their underlying affection - unfold naturally, gracefully, over the eventful weekend. He also harks back to the French New Wave to embody the couple's youthful ambitions and their nostalgia for an earlier Paris.	2014-04-11
Not even Paris can gloss over how this couple's banter and familiarity have turned into bickering and discontent.	2014-04-10
By its ambiguous yet hopeful end, we're at one with Nick and Meg: Sometimes, you just have to dance. Somehow, you go on.	2014-04-10
A small-scale, well-observed drama.	2014-04-10
Funny, original and compelling.	2014-04-09
Le Week-End is a dense relational drama indicated by tricky, wordy interplay and sharply-observed performances.	2014-04-09
Nathalie Durand's cinematography, Michell's generosity in putting Paris on display, and the wit and candor of the performances make Le Week-End a trip well worth taking.	2014-04-09
[It] lacks a solid plot or even much structure -- yet it works beautifully.	2014-04-08
Le Week-End is aiming for authenticity between two people who have known each other for a very long time, but the end result is more like 90-minutes full of two hoary geese honking at each other that is practically excruciating to endure.	2014-04-05
Deceptively lightweight, with dark depths and hidden currents.	2014-04-04
An often intense and poignant comedy-drama [that] actually leaves you wanting more because it's created characters so rich.	2014-04-03
I won't spoil the ending, nor will I deny its playful charms.	2014-04-03
A marvelous little unpacking of the meaning of happiness, precisely what constitutes it, and how to know whether you've found it.	2014-04-02
"Le Week-End" soars because of the glorious leads, reliable Jim Broadbent, veteran of Mike Leigh movies, and Lindsay Duncan, acclaimed on the British stage.	2014-03-29
It's as if the filmmakers are stealthily allowing us to eavesdrop on a marriage that's evolved from bonding to bondage.	2014-03-28
Imagine George and Martha of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' in Paris.	2014-03-28
Not exactly a breezy getaway, the film visits the sites, and drops down on rougher terrain, too.	2014-03-28
This extra-dry mix of drama and comedy is supposed to reflect the complexities of real life; but as a movie, it's so schematic and schizoid, it leaves us scratching our berets.	2014-03-27
Wisely, director Roger Michell ("Notting Hill") does not burden Hanif Kureishi's literate, witty and emotionally nuanced script and the impeccable performances with an attempt at personal style.	2014-03-27
Director Roger Michell ("Notting Hill") has the good sense to step back and let Broadbent and Duncan work their magic on Hanif Kureishi's script. They don't disappoint.	2014-03-27
An alternately prickly and knowing tone poem to desire and disappointment whose light touch belies far deeper, darker human understandings.	2014-03-27
...will appeal most strongly to people near their characters in age, as it's too easy for younger people to wonder why people who have it so good are complaining...	2014-03-27
The actors achieve a terrific chemistry, and the screenplay avoids cliches in its modest exploration of aging and commitment.	2014-03-25
...although certain observations strike a chord and individual scenes work, "Le Week-End" feels stagey and doesn't breathe - it's all highs and lows with little middle ground, bipolar cinema.	2014-03-24
Not whiff of "acting" here	2014-03-22
Consistently surprising and bravely raw, Le Week-End cuts right to the bone, and does so in such an intimate manner, it feels splendidly authentic.	2014-03-21
Even the redoubtable Broadbent succumbs to unchecked pathos and self-loathing. Only Duncan's gorgeous suppleness and alertness keep Meg from seeming cruel and overly acidic.	2014-03-21
The stakes are high but there is no chewing scenery -- it's the natural, casual vitriol that scathes most.	2014-03-20
Broadbent and Duncan have such an easy way between them, the sort of back-and-forth banter of affection and bickering that only comes after spending long stretches of your life with another person.	2014-03-20
A nuanced romance for grown-ups.	2014-03-20
Director Roger Michell and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi -- who have worked together four times, most recently on Venus -- have a keen sense of the vicissitudes of long relationships.	2014-03-20
Sad, sweet, dark, funny and possibly even redemptive.	2014-03-20
"Le Week-End" is a ruefully funny look at a long-term marriage.	2014-03-20
Equally quick-witted and drawing from the same well of low-grade misanthropy (or perhaps it's just Britishness), Nick and Meg enjoy an easy repartee, tossing cutting remarks with the aplomb and precision of circus knife throwers.	2014-03-20
If a movie flirts with brave insight and settles for sweet comfort, that's still plenty nice.	2014-03-20
This film doesn't feel obliged to pick a winner or lob easy answers; it aims to observe, with humor and humanity, with penetration and without oversimplifying.	2014-03-20
If you liked the "Before Midnight" movies, I bet you'll go for this, too.	2014-03-20
Le Week-End is not a bleak film, but it delves so frequently into uncomfortable truths and very personal injuries.	2014-03-19
an agitated film, one much starker and less forgiving than the cheery trailer promises, but with a few notable fillips of romanticism flashing through.	2014-03-18
It's an impressive, relevant, and moving ensemble drama that I can't recommend enough.	2014-05-31
Although The Normal Heart is a work of fiction, the stories it tells about the emerging AIDS crisis in America are honest and heartbreakingly real, thanks to deeply affecting performances.	2014-05-29
There is less reporting on poverty in America than on any other major societal issue. So it is with AIDS. That alone makes The Normal Heart an important film.	2014-05-29
If anger and suffering were all there were to The Normal Heart, watching it would be torture. Luckily, it has heart to match its guts.	2014-05-29
Despite its flaws, this iteration of The Normal Heart also exhorts us to remember.	2014-05-29
A riveting drama about three years in the early AIDS crisis and the struggle of a gay writer fighting the indifference of so many people to this epidemic in New York City.	2014-05-29
Absolutely retains its significance, it's the execution from director Ryan Murphy that's worthy of dismissal, allowing a heavy-handedness to drive the provocative material into frustrating repetition.	2014-05-29
Matt Bomer is heartbreaking as a New York Times style reporter looking for love in a loveless city. His physical transformation is astonishing and agonizing.	2014-05-28
It's movies like The Normal Heart, fuelled by the performances within it, that make you want to learn more and provide perspective on one of the bleakest times for the gay community. That, and increase Kleenex sales at Costco.	2014-05-28
Time, and rewrites, have softened some of the play's stridency. More important, the romance between Weeks (Ruffalo) and his lover, Felix (Bomer), is given a more prominent role as is Felix's death spiral, giving the story power both broad and intimate.	2014-05-28
If you can get past the director's tics and tricks, there are some bravura scenes from Mantello, Roberts and Ruffalo that are worth the price of admission.	2014-05-27
Moving, well acted and important for a generation who may be unfamiliar with the source material. But the TV version, also written by Kramer, doesn't have the emotional heft of the play.	2014-05-27
The Normal Heart is not as powerful as Kramer's incendiary play, but it is still too passionate and potently acted to miss.	2014-05-26
Watch at your own risk, but to not watch the film - or more importantly, learn from it - is an even higher risk.	2014-05-26
Overscored and overwrought, The Normal Heart is a tough pill to swallow. The direction of Ryan Murphy (Glee) is piercingly staccato (and visually inconsistent). The tender moments don't resonate, and the fraught moments feel hysterical.	2014-05-26
A pretty decent adaptation of the 1985 stage script, with some good things added, including an effective pre-credit section set on Fire Island in 1982.	2014-05-26
A passionately-written and heart-wrenching portrayal of real life events, this drama painfully offers a look at the earliest victims of the AIDS epidemic.	2014-05-25
In shocking, unflinching detail it reminds us that silence most assuredly equals death.	2014-05-25
(Larry) Kramer's screenplay powerfully retains Ned's anger but the scenes where Ned exhibits it tend to get repetitive. The film boasts great performances though and lovely directorial touches that make it well worth the nearly 30 year wait.	2014-05-24
In a film directed by Ryan Murphy and with strong performances, including those by Mr. Ruffalo, Ms. Roberts, Matt Bomer, Jim Parsons and Alfred Molina, Mr. Mantello's anguished lament may be the most haunting.	2014-05-23
Teeming with anger, sorrow, passion and purpose, this powerful and harrowing movie is part tragic love story in plague times, part agitprop manifesto and tribute to tireless activism.	2014-05-23
Some 30 years later, this movie-strident, passionate, frenetic, and aching-is a reminder, as Memorial Day weekend begins the summer, of all those empty spots the plague left on the beach.	2014-05-23
The Normal Heart will drive any viewer with a heart at all to tears.	2014-05-23
The good in Normal Heart outweighs the bad, which isn't always the case with Murphy's work. It's an important story packed with vivid individual moments, but with this material and these actors, it feels like it could be so much more than what it is.	2014-05-23
The powerful film, adapted from the 1985 play by Larry Kramer, joins the best of the genre - Longtime Companion, Parting Glances, An Early Frost, Philadelphia, the shattering documentary Silverlake Life - as a monument to the lives lost.	2014-05-23
Flawed but terrifically moving, The Normal Heart is a boldly corporeal expression of gay political consciousness.	2014-05-23
You will learn lessons that should not be forgotten about the fear, foolishness, prejudice and intentional blindness that doomed millions to die who might otherwise have been saved. But the anger that lesson should provoke is either muted or missing.	2014-05-23
The Normal Heart grows in poignancy as characters we've come to know are affected or afflicted by AIDS.	2014-05-22
Powerful, still full of anger, and hard to watch.	2014-05-22
The Normal Heart is a blunt, effective instrument, a handsome, walloping cudgel that begins in gay paradise on the eve of the apocalypse: Fire Island, 1982.	2014-05-22
You should watch because Larry Kramer's play is so much more than an agitprop relic from the early years of AIDS - it is a great play that has become an even greater television film.	2014-05-22
Perhaps it's time for a film about the AIDS crisis that's this emotional, in-your-face, and even manipulative. Be moved. Be angry.	2014-05-22
The Normal Heart...offers a stinging political indictment of the shameful attitudes toward gay men's health in the 1980s and a touching evocation of the human losses suffered due to HIV-AIDS. And the film boasts winning, Emmy-bait performances all around.	2014-05-22
The Normal Heart manages to work both sides of the issue - the anger at inaction and those complicit in turning a blind eye, and the personal toll the disease took.	2014-05-22
It's Kramer's fury, channeled through Ruffalo's manic energy as the writer's alter-ego Ned Weeks, that keeps The Normal Heart beating and preserves a horrific bit of all too recent history not in amber, but in anger.	2014-05-22
It is a movie packed with sublime performances and searingly memorable moments.	2014-05-22
Buoyed by A-list star power, The Normal Heart beats erratically for more than two hours, yet delivers a gut punch in its climax.	2014-05-22
Unfortunately, powerful as the play is, Ryan Murphy's adaptation of it makes for a cinematic tearjerker that's more relentless than it is masterful.	2014-05-22
It's a frightening thing to see, and an example of how Mr. Kramer and Mr. Murphy take one of the play's strong points and, through the flexibility afforded by film, make it even more powerful.	2014-05-22
Written, directed and acted with a passion that radiates off the screen, The Normal Heart is drama at its most incendiary, a blunt instrument that is also poetic and profound.	2014-05-22
After the third or fourth time Ned starts screaming about the same injustices, it becomes all too easy to tune him out.	2014-05-22
A character-oriented drama with theatrical talent and values that would face challenges finding much purchase at the modern-day multiplex. The result is a movie, for mostly better and sometimes worse, that wears its heart on its sleeve.	2014-05-21
This reincarnation of The Normal Heart raises all the right disturbing questions.	2014-05-20
Directed by Ryan Murphy, it's bound to put Emmys in the hands of a remarkable cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Julia Roberts, Alfred Molina, Jim Parsons and Matt Bomer.	2014-05-19
HBO's The Normal Heart will do something to you that TV rarely does: rock you to your emotional roots.	2014-05-19
There's not a wasted second, no imperfectly conceived moments. Like the characters, it feels eternal.	2014-06-02
Akron-area product Jim Jarmusch offers up one of his most accessible films, a vampire piece for the ages -- literally.	2014-05-29
While it's not quite a horror movie, Jarmusch has some fun playing in horror's back yard.	2014-05-23
[The] singular weirdness of it more than trumps judgments that try to pin it down into good or bad, worth-it or not-worth-it.	2014-05-21
Swinton and Hiddleston are sensuous creatures giving depth to the vampire hagiography.	2014-05-18
"Before Sunset with Vampires" may be simplistic, but it's meant as high praise.	2014-05-17
Wanda Jackson's 'Funnel of Love' introduces us to Jarmusch's stylish vampires, his pale lovers, his connoisseurs of art and oenophiles of blood, swanning and swooning through eternity, together forever even if continents apart.	2014-05-16
Jarmusch's vampires live in the (cultural) end of times	2014-05-15
I want to live in this movie. I want to crawl inside it and curl up in its lap and stay there forever.	2014-05-15
Elegant, somber, literary-minded, otherworldy, inexpressibly sad, sometimes very funny. Jim Jarmusch's Only Lovers Left Alive is both one of the most unusual vampire pictures ever made and probably one of the best.	2014-05-15
Only Lovers is on par with Jarmusch's Down by Law, which also failed to capitalize on its considerable strengths.	2014-05-13
Dull, dreary, and dreadful.	2014-05-11
A bloodsucker saga that's every bit as unique as Let the Right One In.	2014-05-10
As in most pipe dreams, there are a few stumbling blocks.	2014-05-09
This is Jim Jarmusch's dark and mournful version of Wim Wenders Wings of Desire ... immortals watching over a decaying city ... burdened by disappointment.	2014-05-09
As handsome and as literary as Jim Jarmusch's agonizingly slow film is, its assets carry it only so far.	2014-05-09
Even vampires get the blues.	2014-05-08
Ava's intrusion into Adam and Eve's existence isn't far removed from Ezster Balint's Cousin Eva dropping in on John Lurie and Richard Edson in Stranger Than Paradise. Jarmusch aficionados will get it; Twilight fans won't.	2014-05-08
This is a film that finds horror not in the extreme, but in the mundane. That alone makes it a worthwhile entry in a genre that it both inhabits and rises above.	2014-05-08
A straightforward, well-acted vampire tale given Jim Jarmusch settings and a Jim Jarmusch vibe	2014-05-04
The title of this film should be Only Jim Jarmusch Fans Left Alive as they're likely to be the only ones not rendered comatose by this pretentious dreck...a tale of hipster vampires that starts off with a touch of style before going nowhere fast.	2014-05-02
Somehow it's all very entertaining and weird and fitting, with Detroit looking like a place any vampire would be happy to be.	2014-05-02
In Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton he has a perfectly Jarmuschian pair of actors, each effortlessly lanky, weird, and wise.	2014-05-02
You don't so much watch this movie as slink into it, joining an unlikely pair of lovers and enjoying their slouchy elegance.	2014-05-01
To say Swinton gives a colorless performance is no insult. With snow-white hair and garments, the alabaster actress disappears into her surroundings like a chameleon.	2014-05-01
"Only Lovers Left Alive" breathes new and intriguing life into the vampire genre.	2014-05-01
Deadpan indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch makes a vampire movie, with undead characters just as terminally and eternally hip as you'd imagine.	2014-04-30
Isn't just like watching paint dry; it's like watching paint dry, scraping it off, repainting, watching it dry again, scraping it off, repainting, watching it dry, and so on interminably.	2014-04-28
Even though the film is visually arresting, it is often slow, and some of the dialogue is oddly expository in ways you don't expect from this filmmaker.	2014-04-27
Like their creator, the characters have feasted on a buffet of historical greats... and the broad nature make it feel like [Jarmusch's] most personal, fluently articulated yet. It's also supremely groovy.	2014-04-25
Great metaphor doesn't work unless it's airtight, and thanks to the director's elegant framing and keen eye for character detail, he holds a mirror to society and shows us what only a vampire's reflection can: absence.	2014-04-25
If you think you can't sit through another vampire movie, think again.	2014-04-25
Only Lovers is so fluidly edited and thinly plotted that it feels almost off-hand; yet, it's also made with great care, beautifully lit and set-designed to an eyelash.	2014-04-25
Swinton, her hair white and long and her eyes tired and kind, and Hiddleston, moody and resigned, are wonderful - delivering their lines with the dry sighs of a desert breeze.	2014-04-25
Languorous, droll and ultimately affecting.	2014-04-24
In "Only Lovers Left Alive," writer-director Jim Jarmusch turns one of his silliest notions into one of the more affecting movies of his career.	2014-04-24
An ultimately enrapturing love story, set on the border of gentility and decadence...Even before the fangs show in the half-smiles, the movie luxuriates in the charm of good-looking actors doing very little. This is Jarmusch's warmest work	2014-04-24
Maybe it was to be expected that the vampire saga "Only Lovers Left Alive" has a sluggish pulse.	2014-04-24
No one here gets out alive in Jim Jarmusch's cool new vampire romance ...	2014-04-24
Despite being a film that features vampires as the central protagonists, Only Lovers Left Alive is less about matters of blood and its acquisition than what it takes for love and romance to survive over centuries.	2014-04-24
It's an inspired metaphor for the fragility of life, even for those who are immortal.	2014-04-24
Fans of Jarmusch might have the upper hand here, but Only Lovers Left Alive remains accessible and, frankly, it's the best movie he's made in years.	2014-04-24
Rarely has Jarmusch's style been so inherently suited to his content. Stillness and silence, the cardinal virtues of his method, have never been so pertinent as in the lives of the undead.	2014-04-23
If Swinton and Hiddleston have a shared gift, it's the ability to inhabit theatricality naturally.	2014-04-22
Jarmusch has written his best script since Dead Man , its bone-dry wit, neither camp nor twee, a tender, mordant expression of love.	2014-04-21
Droll yet visually intoxicating, the film is merely a chance for Jarmusch to luxuriate in everything from classic rock, to art, and architecture	2014-04-19
Viewers with patience will be rewarded by a story of survival that builds toward inevitable tragedy.	2014-04-18
Jim Jarmusch stocks his latest low-key indie with more than his usual characters in low-velocity drift.	2014-04-18
This is a weak entry in the filmmaker's canon, a film that continues Jarmusch's rebellion against narrative while offering nothing in its place.	2014-04-18
Somber but not humorless, "Only Lovers Left Alive" plays to a languid but involving rhythm that is its own.	2014-04-17
constructs a compelling narrative out of what must have been an enormous amount of footage, focusing on the age-old trope of the journey to give the bears' plight for survival a sense of sincere thematic heft	2014-05-12
"And luckily, the movie does gets out of its own way (eventually) and tells a somewhat engaging, 'true-life' nature tale."	2014-05-09

A visual experience through and through, one that offers eye-popping delights at every turn.	2014-05-01
Much as I tried to avoid it, it was sometimes difficult to keep Werner Herzog's voice from creeping in over John C. Reilly's narration.	2014-04-25
Although bears most certainly can be adorable creatures, 'Bears,' the latest Disney documentary to celebrate Earth Day, turns the cuteness level up a bit too high.	2014-04-24
Nature movie fans will enjoy seeing the incredible cinematography of these magnificent creatures in the wild.	2014-04-24
Sincere and unexpectedly good, the film happily reintroduces another element of classic kids' movies: a tidy 77-minute run time.	2014-04-22
Engrossing and engaging - and the closing credits reveal behind-the-scenes glimpses of filming in the wild.	2014-04-20
Huge bears, cute bears, stunning vistas and an age-old story of survival, the G-rated "Bears" is fine entertainment for families and animal lovers.	2014-04-19
What's amazing about the documentary, though, is that it's oftentimes just as engaging as the Disney bears that play in jug bands or crave ooey-gooey honey.	2014-04-18
Some tense moments in Disney's nature documentary.	2014-04-18
A wondrous experience for cubs and mama bears alike.	2014-04-18
A barely bearable bear nature flick. Great cinematography. Boring story & script.	2014-04-18
So much about Bears is awesome in the classic sense of the word.	2014-04-18
You gotta give paying audiences -- especially strapped family audiences -- more than this.(Full Content Review for Parents also Available)	2014-04-18
"Bears" could have used a lot more science; more substantive information in the place of wacky one-liners. Still, the images trump everything.	2014-04-18
Bonus points for all but eliminating the easy scatological humor. Does a bear (poop) in the woods? You won't find out watching "Bears."	2014-04-18
There are grittier nature documentaries out there, but "Bears" is simple and effective, and delivered with that friendly Disney touch. Its intent is to make you say, "awww," and it does its job well.	2014-04-18
All this is heartwarming, in a bloody, ursine-centric way.	2014-04-18
When focused on nature, Bears is breathtaking.	2014-04-18
With gorgeous cinematography and playful narration from John C. Reilly, it's a Goldilocks film -- one that will juuust right for mamma bears, papa bears and baby bears alike.	2014-04-18
Despite the bracing beauty of the wilderness, and the respite provided by cubs at play, the movie is primarily a sobering treatise on survival.	2014-04-17
John C. Reilly's friendly, Midwestern tone seems well-suited to the subject matter, as well as the whole genre, but it's the incredible pictures that make this movie stand so tall, and with so much power.	2014-04-17
The result is an upbeat and frankly gorgeous nature documentary.	2014-04-17
The "nature" aspects of Bears are undercut by the need to turn this into a live-action Disney cartoon, complete with cuddly heroes and nasty villains.	2014-04-17
The devotion and persistence of these animals is a powerful reminder that family connections link all species. With this peek into their world, we are more aware of our own.	2014-04-17
If the sight of bear cubs prancing through wildflowers doesn't make you smile, then you probably won't like the new Disneynature documentary Bears. You also probably aren't human.	2014-04-17
The movie reduces magnificent, savage animals to the dimensions of a squabbling but loyal human family.	2014-04-17
As with all of Disneynature's features, there's astonishing documentary work on display in "Bears" - but a leaner, less conspicuously structured view of the wild might have had even greater impact.	2014-04-17
An enjoyable and visually stunning romp through the scenic Alaskan wilderness with a small family of bears.	2014-04-17
If you want to teach your kid about bears, there's probably a better PBS program you can find somewhere.	2014-04-17
Bears, the latest of Disney's Earth Day releases, might not win any awards, but it has the bare necessities of any terrific nature-doc: stunning images, arresting voice-over and a powerful story of survival.	2014-04-17
As with Fothergill's previous nature documentaries, "Bears" is a story of triumph and family.	2014-04-17
The astounding footage of a mother bear and two cubs fishing, fighting and hanging tough through a challenging year of foraging transcends the folksy narration.	2014-04-17
Whether adventurous Scout is getting his claw stuck in a clam or the fuzzball siblings are riding on the back of their mom as she fords a river, the movie is crammed with memorable images.	2014-04-17
Amid its heaping serving of cuddliness ... the film doesn't sugarcoat the harsh reality and unforgiving elements with which the bears have to contend.	2014-04-17
The Disneynature movies shouldn't be mistaken for traditional documentary, but if they act as a gateway drug for young children to learn more about the animal kingdom, then the films are serving a real purpose.	2014-04-17
A formulaically entertaining combination of gorgeous cinematography and unapologetic anthropomorphization.	2014-04-17
Don't look for Disneynature's "Salmon" anytime soon.	2014-04-17
A delightful portrait of a year in the lives of a family of brown bears.	2014-04-17
True to its Disney lineage, Bears is a theme-park version of reality, but one built on sincere understanding of and affection for the natural world and all its creatures-especially the really cute ones.	2014-04-17
Although Bears doesn't have a stated green message, it's hard to see the majestic natural beauty presented onscreen and not feel stewardship urges.	2014-04-17
There's only so much editing can do to make a bear story seem like a human one, and the filmmakers (Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey directed) also go to unfortunate lengths to give human characteristics like laziness to the bears.	2014-04-17
The movie is so slick, so well-crafted and so beautiful, it's easy to forget that it was essentially made out of found footage.	2014-04-17
Bears works very well as an emotional story of survival and family. But at 77-minutes, it felt a little overlong.	2014-04-17
Bears is entertaining, suitably suspenseful, and amusing, boosted by Reilly's enthusiasm and the natural appeal of its stars.	2014-04-17
a sweet, breezy nature film that the entire family can enjoy	2014-04-17
It may be rated G, but for the most part this is serious stuff, as potentially traumatic for younger viewers as the death of Bambi's mother.	2014-04-17
The best thing Disney does with its theme park millions is put them into these beautiful, kid-friendly nature documentaries	2014-04-16
The result is evocative and compelling, even if it doesn't offer much context or socioeconomic insight into its broader subject.	2014-03-21
There's no balance of perspective, but what the feature lacks in fullness it makes up for in pure energy, extracting a sense of life in motion as its influence by a false sense of security.	2014-03-05
A short, pungent, ambiguous portrait of the poorer sections of Baltimore and the young men who get their kicks riding dirt bikes through the streets en masse, popping wheelies and dodging the police.	2014-02-13
For a first-time filmmaker, Nathan achieves a remarkable balance, presenting each side with very little bias.	2014-02-10
Documentary filmmaker Lotfy Nathan explores the outlaw appeal of an inner-city Baltimore dirt-bike gang through the eyes of a 13-year-old wannabe member named Pug.	2014-02-10
One of the more unique looks at the Other America to come down the line in recent years	2014-02-05
It's the rare film that gets deep into low income inner city life and zeroes in on what motivates those whom society tends to forget.	2014-02-05
An arresting nonfiction look at a subculture of young African-American dirt-bike enthusiasts who view their hobby as a ride-or-die proposition -- a dangerous way to act out proxy battles with authority.	2014-02-04
Well-edited and often thrilling, but leaves you with more questions than answers and feels incomplete.	2014-02-03
An exciting, beautifully shot look at a subculture through the eyes of one of its most devoted admirers.	2014-01-31
It's important to remember that not every day is a joy ride. 12 O'Clock Boys is also a portrait of a family.	2014-01-31
12 O'Clock Boys shows the culture for what it is: thrilling, compelling and more than a little dangerous.	2014-01-31
This slice-of-life effort presents a complicated picture when it comes to the world of urban dirt biking, acknowledging the dangers involved while celebrating its utility as an outlet for the pent-up emotions of a people left behind by society.	2014-01-31
Lotfy Nathan's hand-held camerawork, combined with a snappy hip-hop soundtrack, gives the documentary a sense of immediacy.	2014-01-31
It's positive, it's inspiring, it's beautiful.	2014-01-31
That Nathan is able to cover so much ground in a mere 76 minutes makes 12 O'Clock Boys all the more remarkable and essential.	2014-01-31
It could have romanticized its subjects, portraying them as outlaws and folk heroes. Or it could have gone the way of moral panic. To its credit, [it] does neither of these things - or, rather, it does both, in the most subtle and insightful way possible.	2014-01-31
Take a closer look, as Lofty Nathan does in his freewheeling debut feature... and bike gangs like the 12 O'Clock Boys start to differentiate as more than just a dangerous nuisance.	2014-01-31
[Pug is] a fiercely individual child, but, inevitably, his predicament also symbolizes how poverty can warp a good boy's nature.	2014-01-31
[It] spectacularizes black criminality for white middle-class viewers, the primary audience for the festivals and art houses where this film will have its career.	2014-01-31
"12 O'Clock Boys" packs more life into its 72 minutes than many longer documentaries do.	2014-01-30
In this transfixing documentary about a Baltimore boy striving to join illegal urban dirt bikers, first-time filmmaker Lofty Nathan conjures a unique journalistic excitement.	2014-01-30
The young filmmaker rarely digs beneath the harsh environment's many fraught surfaces. He simply lets his cameras be his guide.	2014-01-30
The film's implication, that the rides need to be curtailed, seems obvious; and I can't help thinking that Nathan realizes this, but stops short.	2014-01-30
Nathan's film defies easy categorization; he's interested in neither telling a fairy tale nor painting issues in broad strokes.	2014-01-30
As reticent as Nathan is to cast explicit judgment, the film shows the tragic impasse between a street culture that's reckless and provocative, and a police force that exacerbates the problem with heavy-handed tactics.	2014-01-30
With so many advocacy documentaries on screens of late, Nathan's unwillingness to take a side is refreshing.	2014-01-30
Vibrantly filmed documentary about a young boy trying to fit in with notorious Baltimore dirt-bike riders fairly throbs with pent-up passions, but runs out of story fast.	2014-01-30
Nathan wisely avoids explicit commentary. He doesn't need it: Coco's angry frustration, Pug's bruised confusion, and the police helicopters constantly hovering above the defiant bikers say enough.	2014-01-30
Its rhythm is the jagged rhythm of everyday life, and its primary asset is its unemphatic authenticity, offering a window into a very specific time and place.	2014-01-30
This visually stunning, thematically complex documentary will stir up a wide range of reactions.	2014-01-29
Engrossing if slightly slapdash.	2014-01-28
It's easy to see how the combination of Zen-like grace and adrenalized thrills might allow someone stuck in a miserable urban hellhole to forget their everyday troubles, if only for a few seconds at a time.	2014-01-28
Not only does it work nicely as a slice-of-life narrative, but it also serves as a subtle study of the endemic hopelessness in America's inner cities.	2014-01-28
In slow-motion shots, Nathan captures the riders' pride in mastery and thrill in adventure.	2014-01-27
It constantly divides itself between fulfilling the conventions of the informational talking-heads documentary and aiming for a more poetically impressionistic quality.	2014-01-26
A brisk documentary happily without talking heads about bikers in an inner-city Baltimore 'hood.	2014-01-13
The film itself is a little too rough around the edges to fully engage. Fascinating subject, though.	2013-12-19
Using Baltimore's dirt-bike groups as its entry point, the film offers a remarkable grassroots look at how the system is broken at the inner-city level.	2013-12-19
Nathan's gorgeous slow-motion shots of the 12 O'Clock Boys riding for the camera shows the glory to which Pug aspires; in the rest of the movie we see the life that's really awaiting him.	2013-12-19
An urban Western with ball caps and bikes in place of cowboy hats and horses.	2013-12-19
Set to a lively soundtrack, 12 O'Clock Boys expresses the paradox of the sport -- its surface coolness and inherent recklessness -- as a single, troublesome package.	2013-12-19
A captivating and nail-bitingly tense documentary that provides a stellar account of Baltimore's urban dirt-bike gang ...	2013-06-05
12 O'Clock Boys is one of those rare, unforgettable films, so tightly constructed and beautifully executed that it's hard not to want to watch it again immediately.	2013-05-10
Nathan's approach is observational and reminds me of the way Steve James constructed Hoop Dreams, following the emerging story while creating context by including footage of Pug and his mother, Coco, at home...	2013-03-12
Lunkhead Kellan Lutz is the demigod's density in Renny Harlin's 300-lite, MST3K-ready retelling of the classical legend. Think Jesus with muscles, by the power of Greyskull.	2014-04-29
There's nothing here to engage the viewer or make them care one iota about what's occurring on the screen, making it no wonder that this got dumped into theaters in the middle of January.	2014-04-28
The film opens on a huge battle in the Greek city of Argos, but it often ends up feeling like the director bought it cheap at the high street namesake.	2014-04-01
Even dental extraction is more enjoyable to endure than this artistically bankrupt misfire.	2014-03-29
No one seems to have high hopes for it - though it might well help to pass a wet afternoon when it shows up on Netflix 15 minutes from now.	2014-03-28
This lousy attempt at a revival isn't even good for camp laughs.	2014-03-24
The lore of Hercules has spanned centuries, yet it's unlikely to ever see a more generic treatment on film than that of Renny Harlin's overblown origin story.	2014-03-24
Somehow more cartoonish than Disney's version, which actually was a cartoon.	2014-02-24
A low point is when Hercules kills the Nemean lion, who seemed to be minding his own business in his forest; not cool, Herc, even if he was all digital and as fakey as those stuffed cats they used to throw at Steve Reeves.	2014-01-24
A misfire from top to bottom so complete that even when you think you have a handle on all the ways it can be bad, it pulls out another one that's even worse.	2014-01-21
Mythical tale is violent and poorly executed.	2014-01-17
This origin story of the great hero Hercules (Lutz) of Greek mythology lacks even one semi-decent action piece.	2014-01-16
Essentially a Monday Night Raw episode with mythological dressing.	2014-01-16
Boldly unimaginative and ferociously derivative	2014-01-15
When awfulness reaches a certain point, it achieves unintentional hilarity.	2014-01-14
Tepid and tedious with acting so ludicrous that it's laughable.	2014-01-13
Through the centuries, the legend of Hercules has survived. It will survive the splat of this big B.C. cheese ball, too.	2014-01-13
Harlin's '90s heyday of crafting fun fare becomes that much more of a distant memory.	2014-01-13
The best that can be said of this latest take on Hercules is that it is over fast,.	2014-01-12
The dialogue isn't dubbed, but is written and delivered so indifferently that it might as well have been.	2014-01-12
[Other "Hercules" movies] at least nodded at classical mythology. Harlin's boasts a Hercules in name chiefly and banks on moviegoers' ignorance.	2014-01-12
It delivers what it promises, which is muscular guys in skimpy clothes fighting and howling, as well as some large-scale digitally enhanced battle sequences.	2014-01-12
The Legend of Hercules may not track, but Harlin still knows how to set up a rousing circus.	2014-01-12
The film has that one slo-mo trick and milks the cow until there's less beef than a Wendy's Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger.	2014-01-12
The only legend this film adds to is that of January's legacy of awful movies. You just shouldn't do this to people.	2014-01-12
Ode to a Grecian turd.	2014-01-12
It's a summer blockbuster wannabe that opened in January instead to recoup the piece of its $70 million budget that it can. The film self-professes its primary character as a legend without making him feel like one.	2014-01-11
More accurately titled 'The Letdown of Hercules,' this Greek drama offers up threadbare characters and an excessive amount of slow motion.	2014-01-11
The kind of resolute badness that makes you idly wonder if you shouldn't just slip next door to catch the end of The Hobbit.	2014-01-11
Harlin makes the genius move of surrounding Lutz with actors who are worse than he is, so the lead doesn't look so bad.	2014-01-11
An early frontrunner for 2014's funniest credit: Ironing by Bogdan Lambev. Mr. Lambev could've done worse than keeping loincloths clean and pressed. He could've been one of four writers who smoothed out this mythology's coolest, campiest wrinkles.	2014-01-10
The whole thing is a total bore.	2014-01-10
The Legend of Hercules is a total clunker.	2014-01-10
Legend Of Hercules mostly just looks rushed and cheap, only coming to life in a handful of fight scenes, and then only briefly.	2014-01-10
You could ask for more -- an actual script, maybe? -- but Harlin covers most of the basics. Or, perhaps more accurately, he leaves them uncovered.	2014-01-10
Not a terrible movie as much as a redundant one since we've already seen much of the source material and most of that does it better than this mostly ripped-off cliche fest.	2014-01-10
The only thing epic about The Legend of Hercules is what a failure it is.	2014-01-10
It's amazing to think there were grown-ups behind the making of The Legend of Hercules.	2014-01-10
A chintzy, poorly acted origin story of the legendary Greek hero that blatantly mimics its genre ancestors while drenching its action in corny 3D and CG-enhanced slow-motion.	2014-01-10
Abominable even for a Hercules movie ... If this were truly the stuff of legend, that word would have the opposite meaning of what it's supposed to.	2014-01-10
The look and feel of a B-movie with none of the edge that sometimes makes that genre more fun than the pricey studio alternatives.	2014-01-10
Legend of Hercules feels like a glorified Syfy movie that lacks the cheekiness necessary to make the whole experience a so-bad-it's-good B-movie viewing.	2014-01-10
Cross-pollinated by sword-and-sandal flicks 300 and Gladiator,this Hercules can't muster the visual punch of the first nor the character depth of the latter.	2014-01-10
This painfully feeble version of the strongman story fails on every level, from Lutz's wooden acting to the styrofoam special effects.	2014-01-10
Everybody seems to have been cast based on their ability to either stare blankly, or to scream, often at the heavens.	2014-01-10
If there were any reservations about just how bad of an actor Kellan Lutz really is, The Legend of Hercules more than confirms it.	2014-01-10
...it's hard to imagine anything being worse than this week's repellant 3D wasteland The Legend of Hercules, a movie so ugly and woeful that you'll wish you had superhuman strength to pluck your own eyeballs out of your head.	2014-01-10
The best way to describe 'The Legend of Hercules' is as the fake movie that teenagers in movies go to see.	2014-01-10
With an unbalanced story and an even worse 3D conversion, The Legend Of Hercules is an abysmal production that feels hours longer than it should - like an undesirable chore.	2014-01-10
I am now staking my claim that despite the fact that I have seen no other 2014 movies, none of them will be worse than this.	2014-01-10
Repugnant	2014-04-22
Though he's not for all tastes, there's something admirable about Wayans's willingness to do anything for a laugh, often reminiscent of Jerry Lewis at his most frantic.	2014-04-22
The [A Haunted House] movies are like a strange sort of exorcism: They chase the demons away by having Marlon Wayans scream for 90 minutes [...]	2014-04-21
Marlon Wayans is killing his own potential, screaming his way into comedic oblivion.	2014-04-20
Mostly, the movie is seriously dumb and just a little depressing.	2014-04-20
Marlon Wayans on his own has taken his family name lower than ever before... even lower than White Chicks.	2014-04-19
I almost laughed when Wayans pulled out a pair of nunchucks to stupidly battle a swarm of dark moths and nunchucked himself in the nuts.	2014-04-18
The line between actual horror and lampooned horror tends to blur these days, and since this effort is neither funny nor scary, it won't help clarify.	2014-04-18
About as contemptible as filmmaking gets.	2014-04-18
A Haunted House 2 is not a movie. It is a nervous breakdown.	2014-04-18
Run in fright.	2014-04-18
A Haunted House 2 isn't the worst way to entertain a switched-off brain for an hour and a half, but it's nothing you haven't already seen.	2014-04-18
Marlon Wayans' parody sequel is as inept and puerile as its predecessor, but let no one say its screenwriter and star doesn't give it his all.	2014-04-18
Calling this one an improvement is like saying that being kicked in the shin is better than being punched in the stomach. Either way, it hurts.	2014-04-18
A Haunted House 2 occasionally tries to be a legitimate horror movie, but just like the comedy, it doesn't really work. Basically, this means you'll be hit with extremely generic jump scares every now and then.	2014-04-18
From Honey Boo Boo to the Kardashians, from Chris Brown to Paula Deen, from Angry Birds to "Hoarders," it spares nothing and no one.	2014-04-18
"A Haunted House 2" is so bombastically stupid that its well-earned R rating doesn't seem sufficient. The movie should come with another warning: The following 87 minutes would be better spent alphabetizing your spice rack.	2014-04-18
You don't walk into a movie like A Haunted House 2 expecting anything remotely scary or serious, but you don't expect to walk out feeling a terrible sense of dread, either.	2014-04-18
The other flavours in A Haunted House 2's neapolitan ice cream are people getting hurt and sex jokes.	2014-04-18
Wayans' performance again relies primarily on mugging it up and outrageous attempts at self-indulgent humor to elicit laughs, topped with copious doses of raunchy sexual innuendo and activity.	2014-04-18
There are almost no redeeming qualities to this movie. It is bad enough to trigger an existential crisis in the heartiest of movie-lovers.	2014-04-18
Though even the most accomplished improvisers occasionally rely on shtick, Wayans simply recycles the same gags; his "improv" is all shtick, with little riffing and no sense of flow.	2014-04-18
I mean, if you were writing a script for a movie starring yourself, wouldn't you also write yourself a bunch of sex scenes too?	2014-04-18
Even fans of the series should wait until they can see Haunted House 2 at home - where they can take as many verbal potshots at its awfulness as they like.	2014-04-18
Why did I need to see scene after unfunny scene of Wayans nakedly humping a creepy children's doll (there must be 10 minutes of this footage)?	2014-04-18
Wayans sets comedy and possibly his race back at least 50 years with A Haunted House 2.	2014-04-18
A kitchen sink comedy more shocking than funny and strictly recommended for rabid fans of the bottom-feeding franchise.	2014-04-18
A movie strictly for the already-converted fans of Marlon Wayans' brand of decidedly off-color, so-stupid-it's-funny big-screen goofballery.	2014-04-18
This send-up of current horror movies is a go-for-broke hoot, a hot mess of a comedy that doesn't have a lick of sense. And knowing that going in adds to the often knee-slapping laughs.	2014-04-18
A Haunted House 2 is dumber than dumb dumb, which at least has the nerve to be unapologetically dumb. Worse, it's Wayans dumb.	2014-04-18
It becomes apparent after only moments that the filmmakers are once more happy to reach for the lowest common denominator, slapping together an icky non-stop barrage of bodily functions, racial stereotyping and rancid epithets and call it a comedy.	2014-04-17
A movie for morons that is offensive on so many levels. It is loud, profane and profoundly stupid. One has to question how a film so awful could even be made, it is that bad. Most regrettably, it is not funny, not even a tiny bit.	2014-04-17
Unapologetically stupid. Proudly stupid. Aggressively stupid.	2014-04-17
I died a little bit inside.	2014-03-27
Richelle Mead's sharp series of young-adult novels might have been better off being adapted for longform TV, rather than the big-screen blunting they cop here.	2014-03-18
Joining the painful list of Goth-drenched Twilight franchise wannabes - Mortal Instruments, Beautiful Creatures, Dark Shadows - comes a half-baked, yappy stab at blending sexy Undead girls into a teen high school comedy..Even hardcore Goths will be bored.	2014-03-15
I thought it was a complete mess. I thought the teenage dialogue was puerile and that was a shame because Daniel Waters wrote the screenplay for HEATHERS, which is one of the really nice films about school but that was a long time ago.	2014-03-10
It is so silly, so convoluted in terms of plot, but so insouciant that it almost gets away with it. Almost.	2014-03-10
Despite an all star team behind the camera this is probably the first occasion where the film is literally impossible to understand without reading the novel first.	2014-03-04
I really did try to channel the 17 year old high school girl within, byzantine, bitchy scheming an' all, but it's a stretch too far, and had to be content with enjoying the performances	2014-03-04
The screenplay by Daniel Waters, the director's brother, is stuffed with puerile dialogue, all the more disappointing given that, back in 1988, he wrote one of the best school movies, Heathers.	2014-02-28
Previous teen films from brothers Daniel and Mark Waters had a lot of bite, so it's sad their first collaboration is a toothless horror-adventure-comedy-romance motivated by The Weinstein Company's eagerness for a Harry Potter-meets-Twilight franchise.	2014-02-24
It was almost touching to reach the end of Vampire Academy and find that it not only left itself open for a sequel, but seemed so certain of that eventuality that it set one up.	2014-02-15
Vampire Academy occasionally plays as if it's on fast-forward, rushing from one moment to the next without providing much reason to care about what's happening[.]	2014-02-14
I can't speak for Richelle Mead's novels, but I'm assuming they read like the instruction manuals for a role playing game: there are both too many, and not enough, rules.	2014-02-14
This is a garbage heap of weak quips, delivered by an assortment of pretty boys and girls and amped up with some cheesy moments of animal cruelty.	2014-02-13
It's not a complete disaster, but even the appearance of Gabriel Byrne, as Lissa's uncle Victor, fails to make much of a dent in the slapdash proceedings.	2014-02-13
Not only plays like the crassest possible mashup of "Harry Potter" and "Twilight" elements, but seems designed to make those franchises look like eternal monuments of world culture by comparison.	2014-02-11
A fast-paced yet foolishly fanged fable...	2014-02-11
When the dream sequence killing off the cast is better than everything afterward, you MIGHT have a script problem... This is why we can't have good vampire movies.	2014-02-09
I'm happy to report that Vampire Academy is actually a pretty fun little flick that shoots for flip and actually lands there.	2014-02-09
This attempt to capture the magic of the "Twilight" and "Harry Potter" franchises tries too hard to pack all the backstory and borrowings into one film.	2014-02-09
[Mr. Waters] doesn't seem especially interested in the supernatural parts of "Vampire Academy," and he clearly didn't have the budget to make what little hocus-pocus there is magical.	2014-02-09
Toothless genre mash-up, which should finally put a stake into the heart of these teen vampire movies.	2014-02-09
Makes TWILIGHT look good - something I never thought I would say about any movie ever - now please excuse me while I go wash my mouth out with soap.	2014-02-08
Had this been played tongue in cheek, and taken to the logical extreme, this could have been a blast. Unfortunately, it's played straight. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2014-02-08
Ultimately more "Meaningless" than "Mean Girls," "Vampire Academy" is a busy, overcomplicated empowerment fantasy with more hormones than brain cells.	2014-02-07
Vampire Academy is just another failure in a long line of similarly structured experiences and quite frankly, the fact that there are six of these books blows my mind.	2014-02-07
Put Robert Pattinson in Grade 12 and outfit his classmates with cleavage that would make Hermione blush, and you have a notion of the joys in store here.	2014-02-07
Most of the time, the actors are working so hard to keep us up on developments in the plot that they don't have time to fill in character details.	2014-02-07
The only thing that distinguishes this teen-magnet wannabe from its predecessors is how lazily it appears to have been slapped together.	2014-02-07
For smart, strong girls, and the guys who like them, Vampire Academy will hit a vein.	2014-02-07
It's "Twilight" as directed by Mark Waters, of "Mean Girls." It's an idea that might have been intriguing 15 years ago, before those movies existed.	2014-02-07
If a supernatural teen film ever required CliffsNotes, it would be this one.	2014-02-07
Vampire Academy will likely only satisfy fans of the books. To most everyone else, it's another disposable addition to the growing pile of cheap YA movie adaptations.	2014-02-07
One idea, mixed with lame jokes, and stretched beyond coherence. Vampire Academy doesn't need a review. It needs a stake in the heart.	2014-02-07
For the target audience - teen girls likely to spend as much time gossiping in the theater lobby as they are to actually watch the movie - "Vampire Academy" is pure catnip.	2014-02-07
If I laughed once more, I would have laughed once.	2014-02-07
Vampire Academy ultimately doesn't have much bite, but that doesn't stop it from trying to continually show its teeth.	2014-02-07
Exposition: The Movie.	2014-02-07
Only a fraction of the scores of attempted jokes work, but it's still funnier than it has any right to be.	2014-02-07
Mark Waters' 'Vampire Academy' is a tedium of heavy exposition, tired pop culture humor and some of the lamest vampires ever...	2014-02-07
Hard to believe the same Daniel Waters who wrote HEATHERS wrote this. The mythology here is hilariously convoluted. Also- the subtext about the Dhampirs being content servants (slaves even) is more than a little odd.	2014-02-07
a stink bomb like this requires the devotion of a true fan to not only figure out what's going on, but why we should care in the first place	2014-02-07
A tired assembly of the expected celebrity voices (Liam Neeson is a despotic raccoon) and already dated pop-culture references (the end credits feature an animated version of Psy leading the cast of animals in a dance-along to 'Gangnam Style').	2014-04-10
Weird as it may be with its dancing Korean pop star and all of its "nuts" wordplay, The Nut Job isn't a tough one to crack. Like most actual nuts, it's pretty bland.	2014-02-28
Hints of the opposing forces at work include a curious subplot about the need for the rule of law (take that, Kim Jong-Un!) nestling uncomfortably against the fart jokes.	2014-02-08
The whole thing looks like a video game you'd rather not play.	2014-02-07
It has many of the genre staples in place, with talking animals and their zany fish-out-of-water antics, but little of the visual or storytelling flair that is needed to separate it from the pack.	2014-01-31
[P]icking and choosing the worthwhile moments out of this disorganized grab bag of tones, gags, and ideas feels like picking through a cheap assortment of mixed nuts, looking for the occasional pecan among peanuts.	2014-01-31
Standard issue in-the-bleak-midwinter animated kiddie movie.	2014-01-26
Like many rodents, the plot runs in circles, covering over and over again the same ground...[Plus,] Psy, who parties like it's 2012.	2014-01-24
There's often some minor animated film that gets dumped in January... This year it's The Nut Job.	2014-01-19
Riffing on the movie's slogan, 'No nuts, no glory,' it could have been a lot nuttier.	2014-01-19
Especially to blame is the character of Grayson, a faux-hero squirrel who makes any open-mic comic look like George Carlin.	2014-01-18
I could rant for hours, but let's just say "The Nut Job" shouldn't be seen by people.	2014-01-18
Not every animated film has to be a Pixar or DreamWorks spectacle of perfection.	2014-01-17
It's January and Liam Neeson has another crappy film out.	2014-01-17
"The Nut Job" is a movie for parents to avoid sitting through with their kids.	2014-01-17
Disappointing animal comedy features insults, fart jokes.	2014-01-17
The bottom line: Kids may be mildly amused by The Nut Job, but adults accompanying them won't find much to capture their interest.	2014-01-17
The Nut Job is a delightfully goofy slapstick cartoon with a surprisingly dark heart.	2014-01-17
Nut Job is a decent (but entirely forgettable) animated crime/caper for younger audiences.	2014-01-17
It doesn't help that the appropriately named main character indeed is surly and unlikable throughout most of the film. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2014-01-17
With an obnoxious main character and little comedy, this animated comedy never really finds its footing and instead stumbles around like a drunken squirrel looking for a place to go.	2014-01-17
It's a nice-looking film, particularly for an independent animated film, but there's just no spark there to elevate beyond something anyone over 8 years old will appreciate.	2014-01-17
While the film isn't the worst of its kind, it might be one of the dullest of recent vintage.	2014-01-17
Only a multilevel chase sequence involving Surly and some glowing-eyed street rats has any real kinetic excitement, and the supporting characters lack visual distinction.	2014-01-17
[T]he movie awkwardly tries to force together two completely dissimilar extremes.	2014-01-17
A confused, puerile "family" adventure that may make children giggle, but flushes the prospect adult engagement right down the toilet.	2014-01-17
Undiscerning little ones in the audience might be okay with it since it's fast-paced and visually diverting, but there are so many more worthwhile, imaginative and teachable films out there for them that watching this one would be disadvantageous.	2014-01-16
The tonal clangs that thwart "The Nut Job" are exemplified during the screwy end credits. Out of nowhere, an avatar of international pop star Psy emerges and starts dancing alongside the cast to his so-two-years-ago hit "Gangnam Style."	2014-01-16
A tedious affair with little to offer other than a chance for your child to see a hugely forgettable romp.	2014-01-16
"The Nut Job" features muddy-colored and often ugly animation, a plot that feels too stretched out and loaded with details to hold the attention of most children, and more flatulence jokes than anyone deserves.	2014-01-16
When the story gets stale, the movie inserts a "nuts" pun or, worse, resorts to a gas or burp joke. It doesn't work the first time, nor the fifth.	2014-01-16
Even these name actors don't give it the vocal punch that would make The Nut Job anything to get crazy about.	2014-01-16
As we see so often in sub-par animation, the focus (literally) seems to be on making every hair distinct rather than in finding a visual way to move the story.	2014-01-16
Even at 83 minutes, The Nut Job feels as long as a winter solstice night.	2014-01-16
Fun, but ultimately not really satisfying.	2014-01-16
Like The Italian Job but terrible.	2014-01-16
Once Surly and Buddy case the joint, develop a plan, and deal with the inevitable surprises, The Nut Job could be any classic caper flick.	2014-01-16
That feeling of been-there-done-that is pervasive, with many of the jokes sounding like they were ripped off from other movies.	2014-01-16
A mediocre family entertainment that can be seen and easily forgotten.	2014-01-16
forced and formulaic	2014-01-16
The Nut Job features decent CG animation, especially of animals, but the writing isn't particularly clever, relying on obvious puns and slapstick humor.	2014-01-16
Spins its wheels like rodents in a Habitrail.	2014-01-16
Someone spent a lot of time making the architecture and production design match the era. Grandparents getting dragged to "The Nut Job" will be appreciative.	2014-01-16
The film isn't really witty enough to make adults laugh, although it's chock full of references to 40's noir crime movies...and it's a little plot heavy for little kids, although they'll probably enjoy the adventure (and fart jokes?!).	2014-01-16
The overall mood resembles a furry, nut-based version of Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing."	2014-01-16
How "Gangnam Style" fits into all of this is a mystery, but that doesn't stop the filmmakers from trotting out that stale K-pop ear-bleeder twice in a move as pandering as the film's multiple fart gags.	2014-01-16
Grotesquely wrongheaded.	2014-01-16
Lepeniotis demonstrates deep artistic vision and a deft hand at pacing. It will be interesting to see what he does next.	2014-01-16
"The Nut Job" fights its protagonist's own charmlessness from the first scene. Turning a dislikable leading character a little less dislikable by the end credits sets an awfully low bar for this sort of thing.	2014-01-16
The feature flatlines quickly, desperate to do anything that might trigger a reaction out of the audience. Considered, thoughtful screenwriting has no place here.	2014-01-16
"What the hell did I just see?" That was my first comment to the studio representative after I screened "Winter's Tale." Allow me to save you two hours. of your life:	2014-04-11
One can only hope this story works a lot better on page than on screen.	2014-03-10
Unashamedly romantic, it is perhaps a little too convoluted to appeal to the most devoted audience for unashamed romance, the teenage girl.	2014-03-07
...quite striking and engrossing...	2014-03-05
A fine book fights gallantly to escape from its straitjacket, but eventually lies down and allows itself to be trampled underfoot by bad ideas.	2014-02-28
Fails with such absolute sincerity that pointing out its incompetence feels mean-spirited.	2014-02-26
For all of its lofty ambitions, A New York Winter's Tale emerges as a hugely disappointing experience.	2014-02-24
Findlay narrates in huge chunks of religiose voice-over. "Nothing has been without purpose - nothing," she concludes. Well, perhaps not nothing.	2014-02-23
'Winter's Tale' may not be the easiest film to follow, but it's one of the most visually stunning.	2014-02-22
A flaky romantic fantasy that spans three time periods and is eye-wateringly ludicrous in each of them.	2014-02-22
A fairy tale concept enlivened with average special effects, a plight predicated upon purportedly epic affection rendered with the most rote and unearned of emotion, and a tale supposedly larger-than-life but lacking in enthusiasm or investment.	2014-02-21
This is a film written, produced and directed by the same person, and the lack of perspective shows.	2014-02-21
Goldsman clearly doesn't know who he is making this movie for.	2014-02-21
With an unbelievable romance, huge leaps in logic and a messy narrative structure, there's little to recommend about this film.	2014-02-21
A-list stars and gorgeous photography aside, this is the kind of eye-rolling, fairy tale folly that gives Valentine's Day a bad name. Your sweetheart deserves better.	2014-02-21
Unfortunately, the film's magical- realist approach comes off as kitsch and preposterous.	2014-02-21
If these actors felt they owed Goldsman a debt, they've paid it in full.	2014-02-21
The fact that this magical romance has been retitled A New York Winter's Tale in the UK tells you what the filmmakers think of the audience: we can't be trusted to get anything on our own.	2014-02-21
'Winter's Tale' (not to be confused with Shakespeare's play) is a beautiful mess.	2014-02-21
A messy, unwieldy affair.	2014-02-20
New York in winter can often mean wading through some dreadful slush, and that's certainly the case here.	2014-02-20
How could this film be made worse? Only by giving Lucifer a scene with Lucifer Jr played by Jaden Smith.	2014-02-20
[Winter's Tale] looks nice and goes down easy-and with a few hearty laughs for more cynical viewers-but has little narrative substance or emotional sustenance.	2014-02-20
A leaden, charmless movie that is unable to commit to its own fantasy. So implausible that even Colin Farrell's own Irish accent sounds fake.	2014-02-20
It is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst film Russell Crowe has appeared in. It may even be the worst film Colin Farrell has appeared in, which is really saying something.	2014-02-20
Largely horrible. But we would go back.	2014-02-20
A gloriously terrible and unintentionally hilarious fantasy drama ...	2014-02-20
It's not a total descent into romantic hell, but it gives a comprehensive tour of the upper circles.	2014-02-20
[Goldsman] wants us to believe in miracles, but a bit of common sense would have helped.	2014-02-19
Composed with all the subtlety of a jack-hammer, this over-narrated fantasy seems incapable of grandeur or magic, reducing its ideas, visuals and performances to kitsch.	2014-02-18
Problematic from the outset, this melodrama about destiny, chance and connections trips over its own self importance as it canvasses its ludicrous plot involving angels and demons, twinkling stars, true love and a magical white horse that flies	2014-02-17
Almost every scene in Winter's Tale has some form of a 'what-were-they-thinking' moment.	2014-02-17
I wanted to like this movie. I really did.	2014-02-17
A spiritual, surreal, stardust-sprinkled journey...	2014-02-17
Corny and shakily plotted, it's a disappointing directorial debut from Goldsman.	2014-02-17
Goldsman's directorial debut is decorated by an A-list cast (watch out for Will Smith, if you must), one can only assume that he has their families held hostage somewhere, because even by Colin Farrell standards, Goldsman's tale is a mawkish stinker.	2014-02-16
A dud of epic proportions, a fantasy that's less magical than risible.	2014-02-16
It's not just the wettest film since records began - it's also one of the most preposterous.	2014-02-16
Through the power of garbled mythology and questionable artistic decisions, it's guaranteed to cure the incurable romantic, on Valentine's Day, no less.	2014-02-15
The film deserves credit for boldly leaping headlong into its premise. No one told it that it was such a far fall from there.	2014-02-15
"Winter's Tale" is much more than strictly about good versus evil. It is really about miracles, and our ability to believe in them.	2014-02-15
It's a fresh, original and beautifully acted fantasy.	2014-02-15
Anyone who has enjoyed past films that subscribe to the "magical realism" concept, or even those who miss the grand romantic gestures often seen in movies from Hollywood's Golden Age, should love at least half of the picture. That would be the first half.	2014-02-15
Caleb Deschanel provides exquisite photography, Oscar winning actors are game, and an acclaimed classic novel sets the blueprint. Yet what was no doubt a passion project for Goldsman has proven to be a satisfying, yet underwhelming movie.	2014-02-14
There's a lot of yapping about miracles in Winter's Tale, a punishingly dull super-natural, high-concept romantic mish mash...And it's just as well. About half-way through you'll be wishing God could miracle your way out of the cinema.	2014-02-14
If you're familiar with the concept of hate-watching or ironically loving a movie, then by all means, enjoy ripping Winter's Tale to shreds with your friends at the bar next door.	2014-02-14
The film is both overwritten and under-explained. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2014-02-14
Winter's Tale is gorgeously shot and the scenery's absolutely stunning, but the physical beauty on screen is lost in a mushy love story that simply doesn't work.	2014-02-14
A miasma of fairy-tale romance, fantasy creatures and the Biblical fight between good and evil.	2014-02-14
Though handsomely mounted, the film is basically just too silly to convince on any level.	2014-02-14
Blended? Blanded more like.	2014-05-30
Blended is pure pablum, loosely masquerading as a "romantic comedy," though its sorely lacking in both those areas.	2014-05-29
Even with its inane script and limp direction, this film is watchable simply because Drew Barrymore is present to humanise Adam Sandler.	2014-05-29
You get a sense of where it's headed as the first scene opens to the sound of a toilet flushing and the sight of Drew Barrymore exiting a public restroom stall.	2014-05-28
Adam Sandler's latest paid vacation (with back-end points) is Blended, a comedy with fewer surprises than a Hooters menu.	2014-05-28
Adam Sandler's astonishing run of bottom-of-the-barrel comedies continues with Blended...	2014-05-28
'Blended' is actually one of the 'better' Sandler films, which is to say it's sometimes almost half-tolerable.	2014-05-28
If you're looking for an Adam Sandler date-night movie, well, Blended is an Adam Sandler date-night movie. It's got all the lowbrow humor and predictability you crave.	2014-05-28
the best thing about it is that as bad as BLENDED is, at least it's not GROWN-UPS 3	2014-05-27
There is no need to guess how this will turn out.	2014-05-27
The film badly misjudges the tone and delivers painfully little in the way of actual laughs.	2014-05-27
Can't really recommend it, but not as awful as I thought it would be.	2014-05-27
Doesn't feel so much blended than most crudely and sloppily thrown together with minimal exertion and even less thought.	2014-05-26
...an admixture that doesn't quite come together, as what might have been a romantic comedy about second chances-with kids-fights for screen time with more typical Adam Sandler fare.	2014-05-26
What's missing from Blended? Two key ingredients: it doesn't touch the heart and it doesn't tickle the funny bone (at least not often enough).	2014-05-26
Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore take The Brady Bunch to Africa in their third on-screen pairing, a coarse romcom that not even their proven chemistry can salvage.	2014-05-26
[A] vomit-inducing blend of mawkish sentimentality and dead-on-arrival humour, all bundled up in a putrid package of festering family-friendly fun.	2014-05-26
Want to help pay for a multi-millionaire's family vacation? Then buy a ticket to 'Blended' and help Adam Sandler.	2014-05-25
It's lazy and only occasionally funny, but then critically raging against an Adam Sandler movie is as futile as raging against the tides.	2014-05-24
A movie that looks to have been written in half the time it takes to watch.	2014-05-24
It's a flawed film - highly flawed - but Sandler seems on track to change his image.	2014-05-24
The romance is sweet and even effervescent, the comedy is homespun and sentimental, but it's packaged with such a repellent batch of stereotypes and prejudices that it's unpalatable even to contemplate.	2014-05-24
I am NOT a fan of Adam Sandler, or his stupid films, but when he pairs himself with Drew Barrymore, he's not nearly as insufferable.	2014-05-23
Somebody call Ripley! Despite extremely low expectations, Adam Sandler has actually made a decent movie. It's also a step up in class from the usual Sandler fare.	2014-05-23
It's not flawless, mind you. However, compared to movies like Jack and Jill and Grown Ups 2, Blended is like Citizen Kane.	2014-05-23
There's a tenderness to the story that should connect with modern moviegoing (blended) families but the film is held back by Sandler's usual low-brow humor and cheap gags.	2014-05-23
In the world of this sitcom love story, men are from Mars and women should be from a defiled menstrual tent far enough away that Adam Sandler won't have to hear them talk about tampons.	2014-05-23
Blended, amazingly, is likely the best thing Sandler has made since Funny People, and it is still a regressive, racist, sexist parade of telegraphed set-ups and unfunny, mean punchlines.	2014-05-23
Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star in Blended, their third pairing, and, while the chemistry may be good, the movie isn't.	2014-05-23
Comedians often draw on childhood influences, and Adam Sandler and his team do it in the worst possible way in Blended.. [which] is like a Bizarro version of The Brady Bunch.	2014-05-23
A lot less painful than anticipated.	2014-05-23
Predictable Sandler/Barrymore comedy has lots of sex jokes.	2014-05-23
The jokes are not as funny as their previous films, but as the years go on, it's nice to see that these two can still provide a spark of romance that's appealing in a family film.	2014-05-23
Sandler & Barrymore. Great chemistry. They're terrific. Their movie is not.	2014-05-23
I felt like it was crushing the soul out of me. But it's still not as bad as Grown-Ups 2.	2014-05-23
Sandler would piss out of the screen if he thought he could get a laugh. This is not his worst film, but it's his most offensive.	2014-05-23
It does not make you want to gouge your eyes out in horror. It is not the anti-Christ. This is not a worse movie than Grown Ups 2. Not exactly praise, but it should take what it can get.	2014-05-23
Juvenile humor and cornball sentiment are hard to digest	2014-05-23
Blended is Sandler status quo - no surprises, no laughs, no life, no hope.	2014-05-23
For fans of Barrymore and Sandler's previous cinematic encounters, this latest effort isn't up to snuff, losing the sweetness and friendly playfulness that elevated their past screen adventures.	2014-05-23
The worst thing about this film, a prize for which there is hefty competition, is its portrayal of Africa.	2014-05-23
Another year has passed, and so, as with the cold inevitability of death, another Adam Sandler movie is upon us.	2014-05-23
A decent movie might actually be buried here somewhere deep, deep down. The world will never know.	2014-05-23
Where's the diarrhea? I was led to believe there'd be diarrhea.	2014-05-23
Call me bwana, but it's three times a charm for Sandler and Barrymore on this totally-silly surfin' safari!	2014-05-23
The movie treats Africa as though it were a single resort town populated by white people who sit down at buffets while black people stay out of the way and entertain them.	2014-05-23
Once upon a time I was a fan of his (Sandler), but alas you can't be sixteen forever.	2014-05-23
Audiences need good family comedies. Unfortunately, 'Blended' is a mix that just doesn't quite come together. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2014-05-23
You have to admit it is not half as horrendous as some of his other movies.	2014-05-23
I think I smiled, twice.	2014-05-23
None of the players exhibits much personality, but it's hard to fault them, given how thinly the characters have been imagined by screenwriters Shana Feste and Joshua Safran.	2014-03-06
Things go desperately wrong after the opening promise ...	2014-03-05
Smart couples can surely find more diverting ways of soaking up Valentine's Day.	2014-02-28
Shana Feste's bland and timid remake will be lucky to be remembered beyond this paragraph.	2014-02-26
Feste is not exactly a masterful button pusher, but she has a clear goal in mind and she achieves it admirably.	2014-02-21
For all its flaws, Endless Love's saving grace is that it is not in fact endless and that you will get to leave the cinema sooner or later.	2014-02-21
If you're a stranger to Mills and Boon or movies like The Notebook, it can be said, with a decent degree of probability, that Endless Love will require endless patience. But it's not without its positives.	2014-02-21
The two stars are too old for their roles but Bruce Greenwood keeps everything grounded with a strong performance.	2014-02-21
If there's any obsession or intensity in this movie, it belongs to Jade's father - a detail that throws the movie somewhat off kilter.	2014-02-20
Endless Love never tries to look beneath that pretty surface. Or maybe it doesn't dare, knowing there's nothing to be found.	2014-02-20
It's formulaic and predictable, but with its two appealing leads and romantic notions, this Hollywood style Romeo and Juliet melodrama about forbidden love, caters perfectly for its young target market as they discover a love that is worth fighting for	2014-02-17
Tepid, maudlin melodrama not worth revisiting...	2014-02-17
The love-conquers-all narrative bears as much resemblance to real life as The Lego Movie, but for all its blandness, Endless Love will be pure catnip for its target audience of teen girls.	2014-02-17
A super-bland tale of love and heartbreak set in a world so soft focus that the strains of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross would seem alarmingly edgy.	2014-02-16
Mawkish folderol...so glossy and bland that you'd swear it had migrated from the CW onto the big screen, and feel yourself inclined to doze off as it unspools.	2014-02-16
Finally, a love story for attractive white people.	2014-02-16
Those of us still scarred by the memory of Franco Zeffirelli's 1981 mega-dose of romantic sludge...have every right to fear this remake. Thankfully the only thing it has in common with that film is the title. It's been scratch-built from the ground up.	2014-02-14
It's just as forgettable as the original. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2014-02-14
This movie has no idea how letters of acceptance work, how airports work, how relationships work.	2014-02-14
This is not a film about love, and all the joy, pain and heartbreak that comes along with it; but it sure does feel endless.	2014-02-14
It's a movie-length cliche about the type of love that explains why drugstores are stocked with cheap, forgettable Valentine's Day gifts bought by teenagers and the immature at heart.	2014-02-14
The same glossy, generic pap that passes for big-screen romance these days.	2014-02-14
An intense but bungled love story that focuses on the middle-aged angst of a controlling father.	2014-02-14
Endless Love lives up to its name. It's purgatory.	2014-02-14
This remake has almost nothing to do with Spencer's novel. It's the kind of film you make when you've run out of Nicholas Sparks books.	2014-02-14
Every generation deserves its own Say Anything, it's own Some Kind of Wonderful. Every generation, however, isn't lucky enough to have its own John Hughes, or its own Cameron Crowe.	2014-02-14
Teen girls may be only ones to enjoy melodramatic remake.	2014-02-14
There was endless potential for this film but the story only allows "Endless Love" to be good for the first hour.	2014-02-14
Why does Hollywood continue to starve audiences longing for a good romantic tearjerker? Endless Love didn't have to be this godawful.	2014-02-14
Shana Feste's film is as cornily trashy as they come, but kind of fun if you're in the right mood for some undemanding candyfloss or a good old emotional wallow.	2014-02-14
Sanitised re-make of Zeffirelli's cult dud.	2014-02-14
"Endless Love" isn't so much a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film as it is an extended ad for the idyllic Abercrombie & Fitch lifestyle.	2014-02-14
...the film overstays its welcome to a degree that's nothing short of disastrous.	2014-02-14
A jaw-dropping groanfest of teen romance cliches ...	2014-02-14
It's the greatest love story no one ever wanted told.	2014-02-14
There are a lot of "of course" moments in "Endless Love." The machinations of the plot grind again and again, and eventually too frequently. What is also difficult to deny is how assured director Shana Feste is at evoking a gushy, swoon-worthy mood.	2014-02-13
Unlike Zeffirelli's film, the new remake has little that will make it memorable even a year from now.	2014-02-13
This is the stuff of pure nonsensical romance, almost nothing resembling what we might understand adolescence or love to be.	2014-02-13
Director Shana Feste has emulsified both the plot and the characters, resulting in a love story with all the texture of Pablum.	2014-02-13
This new "Endless Love" doesn't have enough going on to make it memorably terrible: Banality is its gravest sin.	2014-02-13
Wilde has one of those faces cameras love, thus her other career as a model. There are suggestions in "Endless" that she might have acting talent too. But the director rarely asks.	2014-02-13
Might as well be one long montage of yearning gazes, tender kisses and lovers splashing in sundry bodies of water like playful otters.	2014-02-13
Endless Love tells the story of star-crossed lovers, beautifully.	2014-02-13
There are remakes, readaptations and reboots, and then there is "Endless Love," a movie that bears almost no resemblance to its source material whatsoever.	2014-02-13
A glossy, Nicholas Sparksish wallow.	2014-02-13
This stinker is only good for endless laughs.	2014-02-13
A box of Valentine's Day sweets that's rather too sugary, "Endless Love" goes even milder than the campy, nougat-filled 1981 Brooke Shields version.	2014-02-13
[An] air-brushed, simple-minded remake ...	2014-02-13
Maybe the biggest disappointment about this new "Endless Love" is that the book on which it is based is a smart, beautifully written novel. Unfortunately, the remake is even less like the novel than the first movie was. It's also even worse.	2014-02-13
No amount of candy and flowers will minimize the damage this feckless film will do to romantic intentions.	2014-02-13
Despite substandard animation, this brightly coloured sequel has a strong enough sense of both its story and characters to hold the audience's attention.	2014-05-29
Boasts an impressive cast, catchy tunes and an entertaining fairy tale plot.	2014-05-23
Even by the standards of allowance-snatching half-term filler, this is pretty indifferent ...	2014-05-22
A cynical cash-grab riding on the coat-tails of far better productions.	2014-05-20
This film is very offbeat and psychedelic in that regard, though regrettably not nearly as accomplished or engaging as Alice in Wonderland which is loosely resembles.	2014-05-19
A cheap and charmless reminder to leave the classics alone.	2014-05-19
Kid-friendly with some neat visuals.	2014-05-18
Carping on a film clearly targeted to 5-year-olds might seem unjust, but the filmmakers go about their business in such a lazy fashion that the viewer can't help but feel irritated by the whole ordeal.	2014-05-15
Being an effective virtual babysitter isn't the same as being a satisfying entertainment.	2014-05-14
Problems abound from the rushed beginning all the way through the impossibly resolved ending.	2014-05-14
Resting on the laurels of its namesake, Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return suffers from lackluster storytelling, TV-quality animation and haphazard music, all of which don't hold a candle to the many Oz tales that have come before it.	2014-05-12
Wasting a voice cast populated with recognisable names, this attempt to cash in on nostalgia for its source material evokes more bewilderment and boredom than excitement or wistful reminiscence.	2014-05-11
That it scored a few actual names [...] gives it the veneer of class, but it was designed to fool kids and their gullible parents, yet make everyone who sees it sad.	2014-05-11
Oz has its moments, even to this day.	2014-05-10
Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return reunites Dorothy Gale, the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man-and just about every cliche of low-budget CG animation.	2014-05-09
"Aside from giving some very talented people so little to work with, perhaps the film's biggest crimes are its crimes against cinema and literature."	2014-05-09
A glorified 90-minute distraction for kids - not an enchanting and memorable addition to the Wizard of Oz movie pantheon.	2014-05-09
The bricks are still yellow, but the road doesn't lead anywhere special.	2014-05-09
Kids will like well-intentioned sequel, but it lacks magic.	2014-05-09
It's short on jokes and hampered by unmemorable musical numbers (including one about building a boat), and the film's niceness can't overcome the dopey tedium.	2014-05-09
Dorothy's return doesn't give you much of a return for the time invested.	2014-05-09
A thoroughly Disney-fied Dorothy. Power ballads mixing mawkish sentiment and pop maxims. Still, Short is a hoot.	2014-05-09
The best children's films have a tendency to both traumatize and amaze, but Legends Of Oz does neither.	2014-05-09
This is one of those movies that parents will have to ask themselves if they love their child enough to sit through it.	2014-05-09
Briskly paced at 88 minutes and full of fun and spectacle. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)	2014-05-09
It sounds more like a threat than a promise.	2014-05-09
Ironic detachment and pop culturing pandering are mercifully absent. In their place is a disarming, welcome sincerity.	2014-05-09
The best one can hope for from this movie is that it will be a potent deterrent to those who want to try to make more Oz movies.	2014-05-08
...strictly for the little ones, although serious students of computer animation may want to take a look as well.	2014-05-08
Basically mediocre...what is does is prove there's no place like Victor Fleming's Oz.	2014-05-08
The Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return has some smart writing and heart-touching moments, making it a brave addition to a familiar franchise.	2014-05-08
It's a little shocking how leaden the jokes are in this movie.	2014-05-08
Unfortunately, the computer-animated Legends of Oz can be charitably described as a pastiche; a better word might be mishmash.	2014-05-08
All in all, the beloved kingdom of Oz is not well served, though there's just enough detectable affection to keep it from feeling like a pure cashing-in.	2014-05-08
Delivered with all the vivid, impeccably detailed digital animation one usually sees in non-Pixar offerings of the late 1990s or daytime TV ads for The General auto insurance.	2014-05-08
With dubious scruples, and much Broadway-style caterwauling, the film imagines what The Wizard of Oz would look like with a should-have-gone-straight-to-video chimney on her.	2014-05-08
Devoid of the visual magic and heartfelt emotion of the original film, this version of Oz and Dorothy 2.0 feel like the cheaply made knockoffs you find in a dollar store: garishly shiny, flimsy and not built to last.	2014-05-08
Joyless, witless, and even a tad heartless	2014-05-08
"Legends of Oz" feels like the opposite of the original film. Underneath its aggressive distractions and dim ideas, it has no heart.	2014-05-08
The enterprise, while gently reverent, looks and feels as shaky as it sounds, tonally as flat as Kansas farmland.	2014-05-08
There are songs, by a motley crew of tunesmiths who include Bryan Adams, but except for a showstopper tailor-made for Short, they don't make much of an impact. Ditto for the script ...	2014-05-08
Feels like a formulaic knockoff of the original, replacing most everything whimsical about its predecessor with inane surrogates.	2014-05-08
Directors Will Finn and Dan St. Pierre create an animated musical rooted in the classic tale with wonderful, colorful and detailed settings, and a story that is gentle and sweet.	2014-05-08
Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return is visually energetic but tonally all over the Yellow Brick Road map.	2014-05-08
The merry old land of Oz ceases being so merry in the cheaply animated, generically written Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return.	2014-05-08
"Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return" lacks any sense of magic. These won't be songs you'll find yourself singing over and over after you've left the theater or a movie you'll be watching again and again. Once is enough.	2014-05-08
[A] crass, cheap, hack-job cash-grab.	2014-05-08
Mostly, the film reaffirms how hard it is to make a movie as unforgettable and enduring as "The Wizard of Oz." Good chance you'll forget this one on the way home from the theater.	2014-05-08
Animated in form but completely listless in content.	2014-05-08
Direly lacking the innocence and charm so necessary to this brand of fantasy, this Oz has a few good moments but is more likely to engender viewer indigestion rather than delight.	2014-05-08
Director Tim Story puts a competent visual polish on Ride Along, but it's simply not funny or action-packed enough to warrant a recommendation.	2014-05-28
How much you enjoy it will depend heavily on how much you enjoy Hart's manic energy and self-deprecating jokes.	2014-04-21
What's in the foreground is Kevin Hart's boyish desires and Ice Cube's gruff response. They're the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of bickering.	2014-03-26
There are a few laughs, but not enough.	2014-03-21
It's a typically absurd, exaggerated spiel but with a grim undertone that resonates later on, so that Ben's desperate efforts to make something of himself seem not entirely a laughing matter.	2014-03-21
The paucity of buddy comedies within contemporary multiplexes makes Ride Along's massive failure especially disappointing...	2014-03-18
Hey, if you want to see Kevin Hart screeching like a mad-man and late-period Ice Cube gleefully giving shout-outs to his song titles through dialogue (as I often do), this is the place to get it.	2014-03-16
An undemanding fun ride, ideal accompaniment to popcorn	2014-03-16
Ride Alone is ultimately one joke stretched out into feature length form, and though tedious at times, fortunately for Story, that one joke happens to be a funny one.	2014-03-10
The crime plot is lazily predictable, but the comedy is barely any better. Cube plays the straight man to Hart's manic motor mouth, but anyone who isn't already a fan will probably find his comic shtick more irritating than amusing.	2014-03-08
An action-comedy short on both action and comedy, this turgid dirge recycles all the usual mismatched cop-couple cliches (from 48 Hours to Cop Out) with dreary results.	2014-03-02
Ride Along's fascinating on one level because there's absolutely nothing original about it.	2014-03-01
As buddy movies go, this is strictly formulaic fare but it elicits a few laughs along the way thanks to the relentless goofing of Kevin Hart.	2014-02-28
... the gags and one-liners just aren't as funny as they need to be.	2014-02-28
The inappropriately namedTim Story looks to have grabbed his script from the "plot" section of the service station while racing to a meeting for which he had not properly prepared.	2014-02-28
If you're in the mood for some undemanding action entertainment, this routine buddy cop caper offers some cheap laughs.	2014-02-28
Ice Cube is a man with two expressions, while Hart has become a ubiquitous presence.	2014-02-28
Romantic chemistry is rare in the movies, comic chemistry rarer still, and sadly there isn't much on offer in this action buddy comedy.	2014-02-27
There's a decent premise to this action-comedy, but the filmmakers can't be bothered to put in the effort to actually make it funny or exciting.	2014-02-27
The impression is very much that director Tim Story has shaken down the genre for its most hackneyed ingredients and whisked them carelessly together.	2014-02-27
It's fast, loud and silly with some good set-pieces and comic situations.	2014-02-27
A butch and uncompromising assault of mediocrity and deja vu.	2014-02-27
The plot is weak, the characterisation is inconsistent and it's nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is.	2014-02-26
Ride Along is saddled with an uninvolving plot, and largely content to coast on cop-movie cliches.	2014-02-25
Can you be physically assaulted by a comedy? Anything might seem possible after enduring Kevin Hart's jackhammer performance in this mismatched buddy-cop movie.	2014-02-24
Despite a couple of legitimate laughs, it's largely unwatchable.	2014-02-06
The most truthful answer is friendly but unexciting: They're OK. They're pretty good.	2014-02-04
As a comedian [Hart] has been begging for Hollywood's attention for five years. He has it now, but you've got to believe he can do better than this.	2014-02-03
If you've seen the trailer for Ride Along, then rest assured, you don't need to see the rest.	2014-01-31
... even by the checkered standards of the buddy-cop comedy tradition, this low-brow effort is so ridiculously incoherent that it becomes distracting.	2014-01-31
Because of his brilliant standup comedy, I find myself rooting for Hart. I hope he will have the chance to star in a film that is worthy of him. 'Ride Along' isn't that opportunity.	2014-01-29
If you can't stand The Heat, then stay out of the multiplexes showing Ride Along.	2014-01-25
Only fitfully inspired; most of the really funny bits -- a visit to a shooting range, for example -- were succinct enough to fit into the trailer.	2014-01-24
"Ride Along" an all too familiar trip.	2014-01-23
A buddy cop-ish movie that would need a healthy dose of inspiration to even count as boring.	2014-01-23
This routine buddy picture offers plenty of instant gratification (Cube and Hart are easygoing screen presences, and many of their one-liners are funny) but shows little concern for characterization, storytelling, or even comic pacing.	2014-01-23
This is a live-action cartoon.	2014-01-21
Hart's manic comic invention and textured persona elevates it somewhere beyond the level of pleasing mediocrity onto the slightly more distinguished realm of the agreeable-enough time waster.	2014-01-21
Since the film's largely schematic subplot about Serbian gunrunners can't manage much in the way of originality, it's fortunate that Story knows his way around a comedy.	2014-01-21
A quick roll in a barrel of cheap, hollow laughs down a familiar, forgettable road that we've traveled many times before.	2014-01-20
Ride Along  has the dubious distinction of being simultaneously shoddy and straining, lazy and desperate.	2014-01-20
With a weak, cobbled-together script, credited to a quartet of writers, it's just another a flimsy buddy-cop comedy.	2014-01-20
Kevin Hart's mouth is the sole reason for the existence of the by-the-numbers buddy comedy Ride Along, which rises and falls on the strength of his chattery comic delivery.	2014-01-20
Hart is moving dangerously close to Rob Schneider territory where his very presence in a film is a strike against it.	2014-01-19
Comedian Kevin Hart tries to earn a few laughs in this lame cop comedy but the inane script does him no favors.	2014-01-19
I'd recommend watching one of Hart's stand-up specials and saving your cash until a better comedy comes along this year.	2014-01-18
...the film keeps feeling like an R-rated picture compromised into the lower rating...	2014-01-17
Relies entirely on Hart's shtick for its laughs, of which there are a few but not enough.	2014-01-17
...so silly, so full of plotholes, so unfunny, so hackneyed...being ridiculously stupid is not funny and neither is this movie.	2014-01-17
Some serious plot issues aside, Ride Along borderline works because of Kevin Hart. He's hilarious here.	2014-01-17
[Director Asif Kapadia] allows his documentary gaze to fall upon the sport of motor-racing in this thrilling exploration into the life of a man who aimed to do as much for those less fortunate as he than he did for the sport.	2013-09-08
No, NASCAR coverage on TV never looks as good as this.	2013-01-07
Senna is not only one of the best films of this year, or of the last 10 years. It is one of the best films of all time.	2012-07-01
...a surprisingly deft examination of the power of faith...	2012-02-05
Senna stands as a triumph of [its makers'] knack for story craft and their ability to sort through a staggering volume of material and piece it together into a unified, powerful narrative.	2012-01-27
If we define a classic documentary by its ability to transcend niche subject matter and engage all audiences, then the exhilarating and unbelievable Senna is one of cinema's recent best.	2012-01-25
While this documentary is unreeling, we're definitely along for the ride. But there's no aftertaste, except for that of burnt metal.	2011-11-25
A model of documentary storytelling efficiency.	2011-10-28
Though the film seemingly had a good ambassador for the sport, astounding racing footage and was well-presented, the subject matter never fully engaged me.	2011-10-17
You don't have to be a Formula 1 nut to enjoy this enthralling documentary ... Asif Kapadia's film Senna is so skillfully put together that its portrayal of a complex, charismatic and fascinating figure will grip even those with no interest in the sport.	2011-10-10
"Senna" is a streamlined piece of filmmaking, completely immersing the viewer in Senna's world and never losing momentum as it moves from one breakneck race to another.	2011-10-07
It's impossible not to be impressed by how director Asif Kapadia and writer Manish Pandey have managed to craft a biographical film completely out of archive footage.	2011-09-30
Uses an astonishing wealth of racing and interview footage - including film shot by in-car cameras during races - to chart in a compelling way the dramatic rise and heart-rending end of the Brazilian legend.	2011-09-29
The film is a snapshot in time of an imperfect, interrupted life more than a gateway drug to racing enthusiasm.	2011-09-21
There's no doubt Senna was a great driver, but this competently executed highlights reel doesn't tell us much beyond that.	2011-09-15
...an entertaining, absorbing and inspiring documentary celebrating a champion's talent.	2011-09-14
Captivating, chilling, and surprisingly sublime.	2011-09-09
Ayrton Senna was a phenomenon, and as such, he was filmed, interviewed, and photographed repeatedly throughout his career, images now assembled as the documentary Senna.	2011-09-08
Even those with no interest in Formula One - and I count myself amongst such people - will be captivated by this phenomenal motion picture.	2011-09-04
"Senna" is simply the greatest sports film I have ever seen.	2011-09-02
Kapadia fosters a distinct 'you are there' feeling for the races by composing his visual storytelling entirely of vintage footage, mostly derived from the Formula One archives.	2011-08-27
Exhilarating in the extreme.	2011-08-26
A psychologically intriguing if at times too hagiographic portrait of a man who often held pole position in his profession and felt nearer to God because of it.	2011-08-26
Undeniably gripping stuff.	2011-08-26
I simply didn't care about it, and unless you already know who Senna is and are curious to know more, I doubt if you will, either.	2011-08-26
It's hard to see how anyone wouldn't be absorbed by this fascinating film about a formidable driver and man.	2011-08-25
"Senna" is carefully edited and makes sometimes spectacular use of extensive home movies and videos.	2011-08-25
There's not an ounce of fat or a wasted shot throughout.	2011-08-25
You don't have to know anything about car racing at all. Instead, you simply have to like a great story, one that has all the elements: drama, inspiration, competition, victory, defeat, betrayal and, looming above it all, tragedy.	2011-08-25
As sports documentaries go,...excellent, though in a fairly conventional way.	2011-08-23
It's stripped of narration, talking heads, and anything else that might threaten to slow it down.	2011-08-22
The sound and fury of motor racing is given a spiritual makeover through the eyes and actions of a legend behind the wheel. His name: Senna.	2011-08-19
Even if you can't tell Formula One from Grecian Formula, Senna is pretty exciting stuff.	2011-08-19
Most interesting for the way its construction builds on the inherent austerity of auto racing.	2011-08-19
Real life eclipses fiction in delivering a tale that combines heroism, villainy, suspense and a surprising amount of emotional resonance.	2011-08-19
What makes "Senna" essential viewing is the propulsive education it provides in one of the world's most popular sports, and the introduction it provides to an extraordinary athlete and human being.	2011-08-19
It's 100 percent pure adrenaline, and phenomenally entertaining.	2011-08-19
Senna is a really good movie, and I'm a little bit more into racing than I once was.	2011-08-19
The new documentary Senna has all the full-throttle momentum and sweeping emotion any big-budget feature could hope for.	2011-08-19
Kapadia is working with an embarrassment of riches, but to his credit he selects wisely, and has the good sense to keep the talking heads off the screen.	2011-08-19
Kapadia's access to archival footage is impressive; the coverage is sometimes staggering.	2011-08-18
Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna's life.	2011-08-18
Senna is earnest, eloquent, and impossibly charismatic, and his rocketing ascension through the ranks of professional drivers - gunning his car at more than 200 m.p.h. down the straightaways - is something to behold.	2011-08-18
Engrossing...	2011-08-18
The movie's assemblage of audio interviews poured mostly over astounding race footage is fit for a shrine.	2011-08-18
Even if it does leave us with questions, the way Kapadia has woven together his material leaves us with little doubt that Ayrton Senna was one of the greats, both on and off the track.	2011-08-18
Plays like a narrative feature, juicy and alive, with enough kinetic excitement to hook the Formula One-ignorant (me, I knew next to nothing about the subject), let alone racing fans worldwide.	2011-08-18
Racing absolutely takes skill and knowledge, but Senna doesn't say anything about what made Senna so brilliant at driving fast in a circle.	2011-08-18
"Senna" is a documentary that does the job it sets out to do. I wish it had tried for more.	2011-08-18
[Senna's] is a compelling and human story, albeit a tragic one. There's no need for it to be sugar-coated for it to remain inspiring.	2011-08-17
It's popcorn-chomping fun rooting for the soul-stripped Hex as he battles his way toward redemption and sweet, sweet payback.	2013-02-15
It's a little too brief to get bored exactly, but it's certainly long enough to get frustrated at the lack of the essential ingredients to get the audience engaged in its story.	2012-09-25
It's a standard Western revenge tale dressed up with supernatural elements.	2011-07-14
The mark of a good actor is being good in a really bad movie. Josh Brolin is a really, really good actor, because most of the time he's on screen speaking you can almost forget what a loathsome, irredeemable, turd of a film Jonah Hex is.	2011-03-29
When it works, which it does quite often, it's one of the better comic book adaptations of recent years.	2010-12-14
Seems almost calculated meticulously to suck the life out of its audience as much as humanly possible...	2010-12-05
The film is simply too brief, too befuddled and too delirious to do the comic book legend justice.	2010-10-20
An awful excuse for cinema that ultimately fails in nearly every way possible.	2010-10-20
...remarkably two-dimensional, showing evidence of having been edited down from something more complex.	2010-10-12
To quote Clint Eastwood's Monco in For A Few Dollars More, you people need a new sheriff.	2010-09-09
Jonah Kex, Jonah Wrex, Jonah Hax, Jonah Kax, Jonah Thix, Jonah Crox, Jonah Sux.	2010-09-08
The film shows its comic-book origins in good ways (stylish settings) and bad (too many scenes end in a gigantic conflagration).	2010-09-03
Whether it's the director's fault or the result of studio meddling, this is a mess of a movie that's been cut to pieces.	2010-09-03
It just gets louder and more nonsensical as it progresses, with Fox shoe-horned into as many scenes as possible.	2010-09-02
Almost everything is wrong with it.	2010-09-02
Having already bombed big-time in the US, our search for the biggest turkey of 2010 ends right here.	2010-09-02
At least it's relatively short.	2010-09-02
It's a loud and subtle-as-a-sledgehammer assault on the senses, though, at 81 minutes, mercifully short.	2010-09-02
[A] dull and messy ride through supernatural Clint Eastwood territory.	2010-09-02
An object lesson in how not to adapt a comic book. A crushing disappointment.	2010-09-01
At 81 minutes with credits, Jonah Hex feels crude, lazy and entirely perfunctory.	2010-09-01
thin, dull, messy story that's short but feels much longer. It's all flashy explosions and effects and no substance.	2010-09-01
Scarcely even feature length, and bewilderingly chaotic.	2010-09-01
There's plenty of bangs for your buck -- check out the dynamite-heavy ambush of a steam locomotive in the opening sequence.	2010-09-01
Has obviously been hacked to pieces and is hampered by lazy supporting performances, several utterly pointless scenes and the fact that all the violence happens offscreen.	2010-09-01
There's the germ of a great idea in this premise, but it's flattened by sledgehammer direction that smashes any possibility out of each scene.	2010-08-29
Jonah Hex could be bigger, louder and longer, with more special effects and faster cutting, but it errs on the side of simplicity. And to that, let's all raise a shotglass.	2010-07-06
There's just one ingredient missing: anyone with a clue.	2010-07-06
Jonah Hex isn't necessarily a bad film, it's just nothing at all.	2010-07-06
Jonah Hex misfires. Repeatedly.	2010-07-06
Yes, it squanders its Sergio Leone-worthy source material, but it's a surprisingly entertaining disaster -- a sort of Concorde-New Horizons picture for the new millennium.	2010-07-02
A horse opera with a hex.	2010-07-01
The bad and the ugly are both covered, with a main character that has a scarred face and a deep desire for revenge. As for the good? That's more of a hit-or-miss proposition.	2010-06-30
80 some odd minutes of bland, boring, tedious nonsense. Utterly inept and squandering potential at every opportunity, the only 'interesting' thing the film has going for it is an ending that is totally bizarro, terribly conceived and bafflingly stupid.	2010-06-29
What do you get when you make a movie out of a comic book that's not worth reading?	2010-06-28
When making a feature film based on a Western horror comic, (don't) remove it from the Old West, sanitize the horrific bits, and mistake the term "comic" for the funny kind.	2010-06-27
John Malkovich and Josh Brolin are too good for the sloppy, overripe Jonah Hex.	2010-06-25
Jonah Hex is one big rush, but not in the positive sense.	2010-06-25
...a seriously uneven missed opportunity...	2010-06-25
Scripted by Crank scribes Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, and starring a game Josh Brolin, this probably looked good on paper.	2010-06-25
Distinct from its various narrative failings, this DC comic book adaptation is most notable for how skimpy and curiously under-sketched it feels.	2010-06-24
Embarrassing for everyone involved.	2010-06-24
A sprawling, incoherent mess of a movie, all style (bad), no substance (worse), and capturing little if any of DC's Seventies-era mucho mojo.	2010-06-24
Had it been available to him, Max Bialystock would have opted for this as his guaranteed flop rather than Springtime for Hitler.	2010-06-23
All three of you clamoring for a sequel to Wild Wild West have got your wish.	2010-06-23
It's enough to make you want to kill the film reels, bring them back to life and then kill them again.	2010-06-22
A badly disfigured hero and a cliched heart of gold heroine are wrapped up in an inane plot. It makes you wonder just why did they make this movie?	2010-06-22
Josh Brolin grits half his teeth for the whole movie. I just can't tell if he's doing it to stay in character, or because he's disgusted with everyone else's effort in the film.	2010-06-21
Who needs a story that makes sense when it's only camp that you're after?	2010-06-20
"Jonah Hex" is a movie missing every element of what makes a movie. It's a gritty comic book adaptation without the grit. It has characters without character in a story without storytelling.	2010-06-20
It manages to not only contort itself into a form that is simultaneously convoluted and stupid but it also skilfully avoids any audience engagement despite a tumultuous whirl of spectacle and noise.	2013-11-25
The demon-haunted West Virginia town still gives the creeps... but this belated sequel proves to be only fitfully exciting and scary - mostly because the action stops every few minutes for yet another character to deliver reams of boring exposition.	2013-03-19
There has to be someone out there who can make a successful video-game adaptation because faith is being lost year after year and Silent Hill: Revelation does nothing for the many unwavering believers.	2013-02-19
Just how terrible is SH3D? Well, at one point, writer-director Michael J. Bassett actually tries to scare you with a Kellogg's Frosted Pop-Tart. No kidding.	2013-02-15
Put this much effort into bringing your idea of Hell to the screen, film fans will start calling you Satan. And not in a good way.	2013-01-05
I can't imagine anyone who hasn't played the video game who would give a shout-out to the 'Silent Hill' sequel.	2012-11-20
It's like going through a cheesy house of horrors at the local carnival. You want it to end, but not because it's scary.	2012-11-11
( ... ) saturated with over-the-top sound effects. Did nobody realise that it's called Silent Hill?	2012-11-09
It's in too much of a rush, and tries to cram in so much plot that unless you're familiar with the game it's closely adapted from, chances are it will leave you baffled.	2012-11-09
With Bean unable to save the unsavable, we're left with waves of hard-working special effects trying to torture Heather instead of being able to enjoy a top star on form.	2012-11-07
While Silent Hill: Revelation 3D may not allay your hankering for a solid story, it'll definitely satisfy your blood-lust.	2012-11-06
Can't even offer up the flashy production design that aficionados of the game liked about the Christophe Gans-directed original.	2012-11-04
A sacrilegious adaptation of an excellent video game, Silent Hill: Revelation will infuriate gamers, and just confuse everyone else.	2012-11-02
"Come to Silent Hill" reads a "scary" message left for teen damsel Heather. Hell, no.	2012-11-02
I realize it's called Silent Hill for a reason, but enduring this botched (video game-based) nightmare is like sleepwalking into the world's dullest Halloween party.	2012-11-02
The random, hectic storyline has little rhyme or reason, the unimaginative 3D feels like a rip-off and only Clemens seems to be taking this seriously.	2012-11-01
The only solace is that there is no direct threat of a sequel.	2012-11-01
More of the same, on a cut-rate budget, without Gans's atmospheric reverie.	2012-10-31
This mess makes no sense and plods along for 90 minutes throwing things at us that are neither scary nor contributing to the tale.	2012-10-31
I would rather go to Hell than sit through that movie again.	2012-10-31
Another horror franchise that needs to be terminated.	2012-10-31
Part disturbing, part daft, thanks to an incredibly poor script (which makes no sense whatsoever) and some patchy performances, but the sequel's striking cinematography can't be knocked.	2012-10-31
Incomprehensible, ridiculously humorless horror fantasy.	2012-10-29
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D is a sequel to the slightly less-mad horror film Silent Hill, both of them based on a video game. This makes it a rare triple-header of indications that this is not a film for the more mature moviegoer.	2012-10-29
Radha Mitchell visits Sean Bean in a mirror cameo. 'Do I look fat in this mirror?' Radha asked. 'I wouldn't know,' quipped Sean. 'This movie isn't reflecting well on anybody.'	2012-10-29
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D is a mixed bag of creepy and downright captivating visual set-pieces coupled with melodramatic dialogue and an overly-complicated storyline.	2012-10-28
"Revelation" is incredibly boring as well as totally baffling.	2012-10-28
It's a shame Silent Hill: Revelation suffers the same doomed fate as most modern horror movies, bumbling through a shockingly disconnected screenplay which strings together moments that could have been salvaged otherwise.	2012-10-27
Unfortunately, the writing is so weak and comes up so short that all the striking imagery amounts to practically nothing.	2012-10-27
Demonstrates what half the budget and twice the story can do to turn a fake nightmare into a real chore.	2012-10-26
Set piece, set piece, exposition, set piece, boss fight, set piece, more exposition, boss fight, boss fight, open the door for another sequel, the end.	2012-10-26
The good news for crummy-horror-movie fans is that there's a whole lot more fun in this one since it's dumber and shorter than the first entry.	2012-10-26
The distinction between actors and special effects shrinks ever further in the video game-turned-horror film Silent Hill: Revelation 3D, which reduces its human players to plastic action figures in tired genre settings.	2012-10-26
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D quickly devolves into a smorgasbord of sutured faces and blades poking the viewer in the eye.	2012-10-26
It's never a good sign when the trailers playing before a film have richer, more complete narratives than the feature you've paid to see.	2012-10-26
Silent Hill Revelation 3D is an inferior sequel in every way, shape and form, a horror sequel that fails to either intrigue or scare, and one that just might have killed the franchise cold-dead.	2012-10-26
An ugly, assaultive collection of jump-scares.	2012-10-26
Once the 3-D special effects look dated, this head-scratcher of a movie could be ripe to become a camp classic. But for now, the humorless approach to this inane mess is embarrassing rather than hilarious.	2012-10-26
Silent Hill is not a place you want to go, and that applies for moviegoers as well as this videogame adaptation's characters.	2012-10-26
Let's forget the fact that the demon killed everyone in the town in the first film because obviously the filmmakers did.	2012-10-26
It confirms once again that with the notable exception of Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, a film that feels like a videogame is never a positive development.	2012-10-26
With horror altogether absent and a plot drowning in insipid convolutions, it's a film whose early warning to Heather should be heeded: "Don't go to Silent Hill."	2012-10-26
"Do not go to Silent Hill!" That's one of the first lines of dialogue, but by that point you've probably already realized the magnitude of your mistake.	2012-10-26
A cheaper, cheesier sequel that's worse than its predecessor on every level (save being a half-hour shorter) and takes no special advantage of the stereoscopic process.	2012-10-26
Silent Hill: Revelation fundamentally misunderstands the appeal its source material.	2012-10-26
Stick with the games. At least in the games you can press "skip" when confronted with nine goofball dialogue scenes in a row.	2012-10-26
As far as sub-literate, incomprehensible pieces of garbage are concerned, 'Silent Hill: Revelation 3D' is one of the year's best.	2012-10-26
The biggest mystery about this quicky exploitation horror flick is not its father-daughter tale, which is structurally messy and ineptly helmed, but how it got such talented actors.	2012-10-26
Only true devotees of the game are likely to recognize many of the figures on the screen, or care about a byzantine story stitched together from innumerable horror and fantasy shows.	2012-10-26
It's like watching a recording of someone else playing a video game. You have no control and you have nothing invested in the characters or the outcome.	2012-10-26
"'Transcendence' winds up being in the position of being the first - but certainly not the last - big disappointment of the 2014 Summer Movie Season."	2014-05-09
Transcendence neither thrills nor illuminates. In fact in many respects it is downright cowardly in its failure to pursue its many themes, with threads of ideas never woven into a whole.	2014-05-06
The movie is rhythmless, shapeless, and, with the exception of a few shots, cheesy-looking.	2014-05-05
Here's yet another example of a high-concept mega-movie that appears to have gone into production a draft or two too early.	2014-05-02
It is streets ahead of most of what we get that is labeled science fiction. It's intelligent. It explains its premise -- within reason. Its dialogue isn't chuckleheaded.	2014-05-02
Nevertheless, Transcendence is superior to most other sci-fi films these days; it's briskly paced, consummately made and never boring. Puzzling and occasionally challenging it may be, but it's made with style and imagination.	2014-05-02
Transcendence is a film where, when the world's first ever human brain upload doesn't work, the people responsible fix it by turning the computer off and on again.	2014-05-02
With a script as loopy as this one, it pays to cast intelligent-looking actors. They can delude you into feeling as if you're watching something interesting.	2014-05-02
With actors this good, we'll go almost anywhere, even unto that silliness.	2014-05-02
built on a set of intriguing moral and ethical conundrums involving our relationship with rapidly evolving computer technology, but it finds virtually no dramatic traction	2014-05-01
A relatively entertaining way to upload your consciousness for 119 minutes.	2014-04-30
Transcendence is a movie without villains, thrills or, after Nolan fanboys show up, much of an audience.	2014-04-29
What an empty and misguided movie this is.	2014-04-29
[A] pallid and self-serious genre trifle.	2014-04-28
A genuine artificial intelligence would've completely redesigned this film.	2014-04-27
Anyone with a fondness for broad canvas, ideas-heavy sci-fi should ignore the negative scuttle and give Transcendence the benefit of the doubt.	2014-04-27
...no doubt there's an interesting movie to be plotted along [these] lines. But for all its pretension, Transcendence isn't it. It's just a big dumb popcorn muncher.	2014-04-27
Far too slow-paced to work as a thriller and too shallow to properly challenge us as science fiction, this film is unlikely to please many audience members.	2014-04-27
...a misguided failure that hardly bodes well for Pfister's directorial career.	2014-04-27
A lighter touch could have produced campy, B-movie pleasures from the material, but Pfister's solemn approach drains the fun from the film. And a miscast Depp, his star wattage surprisingly dimmed, fails to supply the missing spark.	2014-04-27
Depp used to be the most reliable actor in Hollywood. Not anymore.	2014-04-26
What should have been a brain in a vat just became a brain in a blender.	2014-04-25
A giant third-act bellyflop isn't quite enough to spoil it totally.	2014-04-25
An ambitious, old fashioned, ideas-driven science fiction film that is never as mind-expanding as its futuristic images and topical, dystopian ideas seem to promise.	2014-04-25
An A-list cast and talented filmmaker are wasted on a B-Movie script with pretentions of prescience.	2014-04-25
Unfortunately, it ends up playing like Max Headroom Conquers the Universe.	2014-04-25
Despite boasting a seemingly ripe filmmaker working with proven actors, the result feels more like a bigger budgeted yet disappointing episode of The Outer Limits.	2014-04-25
An intriguing concept that devolves into a somewhat silly adventure tale, 'Transcendence' is overly long and contrived.	2014-04-24
As a thriller set in the genuinely fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, it is a disappointment.	2014-04-24
With this cast and these ideas, Transcendence is enjoyable but a missed opportunity.	2014-04-24
Pfister should be applauded for making a non-franchise property with ideas and aspirations but Transcendence is nowhere near as grand as its title. Gleaming visuals aside, it's a disappointment.	2014-04-24
Remember when paycheck-hungry actors were accused of phoning in a performance? Johnny Depp spins that for millennials in Transcendence by Skpying in his performance.	2014-04-24
This is like a heavy-handed and humourless version of Spike Jonze's postmodern comedy Her, mulched in with the old sci-fi novel Donovan's Brain, about keeping someone's brain alive in a tank.	2014-04-24
Transcendence is a sci-fi movie that should be daft fun but is, disappointedly, plodding and dull.	2014-04-24
Pfister's experience shows in that the film is beautifully arranged; unfortunately, that's the best thing about it.	2014-04-24
The only part of [Depp] still genuinely dynamic is his hair. I'm worried.	2014-04-24
Transcendence borrows ideas from so many sci-fi sources it turns into a messy cinematic stew that fails to deliver its own unique flavor.&#8233;	2014-04-24
The worst, most portentous, and certainly the silliest big-budget science fiction film since the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still.	2014-04-24
Look, I think it goes so over the top... There are so many twists and turns too. But, look, basically I think this is an entertainment.	2014-04-23
The irony for Depp is that the better he is in the role the more thankless it becomes.	2014-04-23
The strangest thing about Paglen's script is how out of step it feels with modern technology - it could have been lingering in a drawer since the mid-'90s, so outmoded is its tone.	2014-04-23
Unfortunately, this excellent set-up is squandered in a miasma of truly, frustratingly obtuse plot holes and ludicrous gaps in logic.	2014-04-22
A decade late and a dongle short.	2014-04-21
The performances are fine, as one would expect with this cast, but the writing and sadly the directing in "Transcendence" lacked the vision or coherence necessary to make such a high-concept film fly.	2014-04-21
'Transcendence' seems to be simultaneously making a case for and against technology, and while this level of ambiguity can be compelling in a good movie, in a lousy one it just winds up being frustrating.	2014-04-21
When it's all over, you will turn on your iPhone and ask Siri to find you a good restaurant for a bite to eat near the theater. And you will have learned nothing.	2014-04-21
Rebecca Hall['s] impersonation of grief and a crumbling psyche is by far the most film's most human aspect.	2014-04-21
Transcendence aspires to be a philosophical rumination about the future of artificial intelligence, but it's really just an exercise in superficial intelligence.	2014-04-21
A techno-thriller that systematically squanders an interesting concept. Overstuffed but underdeveloped, it mistakes serial incident for dramatic connection.	2014-04-21
"Transcendence" is a moronic stew of competing impulses - bad science meets bad sociology meets bad theology ...	2014-04-20
Aronofsky's signature grandiosity is too often at odds with -- and diminished by -- the familial melodrama he has created aboard the vessel.	2014-05-21
Noah manages to be both reverent and action-conscious, but not strongly either one.	2014-05-14
It ranges far, wide and clumsily in expanding its slender source material, but Noah aches with aspiration, its sincerity and ambition virtually leaping off the screen.	2014-04-28
It's ultimately clear that the movie could've lost half of its running time without sacrificing any of its important story and character beats...	2014-04-27
It's certainly not the sometimes-whimsical Bible story that's told to so many children. Director Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah' is a drama about a tormented man determined to do God's bidding and about people who are ravaging the earth.	2014-04-24
Aronofsky makes an intermittently arresting Bible movie	2014-04-18
Aronofsky's grand, crazy vision is filled with more awe and reverence than a traditional snoozefest like Son of God, and, in its fun, flawed and chaotic way, Noah is a popcorn flick about the endless wonders of the universe and of the human soul.	2014-04-16
Darren Aronofsky upends convention-but stays true to the bible-with this controversial epic.	2014-04-16
Pro-vegan and anti-industrial messages aside... as (a) non-Biblical, alternative history version of the Great Flood, there's some interesting stuff going on here.	2014-04-16
A water-logged turkey...an epic disaster of truly biblical proportions...Bloated, gloomy, super self-serious and - worst of all - boring, the film is so dull and portentous it's likely to make atheists convert, just so they can pray to God to save them.	2014-04-11
There is so much here that is wonderful and strange, my problems with the film are not much more than quibbles. ... I think Noah is Darren Aronofsky's Take Shelter.	2014-04-11
Add Darren Aronofsky's "Noah" to the list of Bible-themed film epics ranging from magnificent to stuffy to silly.	2014-04-11
An auteurist monument to monomania inspired by Judeo-Christian culture's most famous report of a divine reboot..	2014-04-11
A bold, trippy new interpretation of an old, old story, about miracles of varying size and shape, in which we still today might find some new angles of inspiration.	2014-04-11
a deeply insane interpretation	2014-04-10
What's finally impressive about Noah, even to those of us who are hardly unconditional Aronofskians, is the degree of unbending faith on which this massively ambitious venture is built.	2014-04-10
It's interesting. It's too long. It's three stars from me.	2014-04-09
Darren Aronofsky continues to ambitiously experiment with genres in this Old Testament blockbuster, but this is his first real misstep as a filmmaker, as the impressive parts simply don't add up.	2014-04-07
Darren Aronofsky has managed ... intrigue, and pointed ecological commentary, in among the blood, wrath and spectacle of this fascinating Old Testament adaptation.	2014-04-07
In a single sequence, Aronofsky combines creationism, Darwinian evolution, original sin, the end of days, and radical environmentalism.	2014-04-07
Noah manages the miracle of Crowe shouting at the heavens without looking absurd, not to mention the miracle of bringing the Bible movie back to life, and making it watchable and contemplative.	2014-04-07
The strangest $125m ever spent by a major studio.	2014-04-06
O Antigo Testamento e um O Senhor dos Aneis no qual Deus e simultaneamente Gandalf e o olho de Sauron.	2014-04-06
It has, in religious parlance, been sent to test you.	2014-04-06
We now have the world's first $125 million stoner film.	2014-04-05
There is, in this singular film, enough crackpot philosophy, apocalyptic violence, environmental evangelism and portentous dialogue to inspire a whole new religion.	2014-04-04
The domestic melodrama and psychological realism which Aronofsky gives Noah to wrestle with are interesting enough, and Russell Crowe is the ideal actor to show Noah brooding upon his lot.	2014-04-04
Biblical epics don't come any more soggy or bombastic than Darren Aronofsky's Noah.	2014-04-04
Cinematically and philosophically daring, this is a reworking of the flood story that speaks to 21st century realities and that will make you think hard about "the Creator's" capriciousness.	2014-04-04
The very elements that make Noah less viable as a biblical blockbuster also mark it as an earnest engagement with faith.	2014-04-04
It's an impressive spectacle - the ark itself is built to scale - but occasionally unsure of whether to be epic or relevant.	2014-04-04
It's epic filmmaking that flits between surreal class and utter lunacy, and even though it's occasionally ridiculous and you know how it ends, it's ultimately worth the ride.	2014-04-04
If, quite understandably, you enjoy seeing Russell Crowe being manly and bashing baddies, you won't be disappointed, especially if you're not too old. But really...	2014-04-04
The effect is rather as if the Book of Genesis had been rewritten by J.R.R. Tolkien, or J.K. Rowling.	2014-04-03
While Aronofsky's craft can be beautiful to behold, controversy seems to be the gospel he preaches loudest. Understand that before you buy your ticket.	2014-04-03
A bold, fearsome epic about man's folly.	2014-04-03
For all the high-tech showmanship on display, this retelling of Noah and the Ark marks a serious effort to engage with the Old Testament as a literary text.	2014-04-03
Frankly, once I got over the absurd novelty of the rock monsters, and the notion of Noah as a kind of deranged cult leader, I just gave up and gave into it.	2014-04-03
Despite the film's visual marvels, its creators all take themselves a tad too seriously.	2014-04-03
Something has been lost in the storm.	2014-04-03
Fascinating, but rather flawed.	2014-04-03
This movie is totally nuts!	2014-04-03
The problems of old-school bible movies are here in abundance. Just like the parting of the red sea [from The Ten Commandments], the flood is the bit ... that you'll be waiting for when Noah plays on the telly for eons to come.	2014-04-02
In addition to recognition of his latest film's technical achievements, (director Darren) Aronofsky deserves more credit than he has received from believers thus far for making a serious, unabashedly religious epic.	2014-04-02
By the close Noah is not just a story brought back to life, with every grandeur re-conferred, but a story's characters too. We are aboard, we feel, with a real Noah, his real wife, even (however apocryphal) a real Cain.	2014-04-02
A powerful story of belief, devotion and ruinous obsession.	2014-04-02
Burdened with great purpose but rich with ideas	2014-04-02
Poised somewhere between a film of pure wonder and a more explicitly religious action text, Noah is a big and interesting and evocative and at times sigh-inducing work, for a variety of reasons.	2014-04-01
Darren Aronofsky's Noah, like the good book it springs from, is wide open to interpretation. Bold yet reverent, his head-trip take on the biblical legend is bound to confound literalists wondering what in the name of Cecil B. DeMille is going on.	2014-04-01
Compellingly weird and occasionally wonderful to behold.	2014-04-01
